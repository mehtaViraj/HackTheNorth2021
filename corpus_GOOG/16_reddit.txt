The year of 2020 is the year of the Gold (Metal) Rat 🧧 Also known as the rat race to the top. The year shows prosperity towards business and finance in the automotive, tech, information and healthcare sectors. Which is being reflected.

But this year, especially this earnings szn will be pivotal. Place your bets ladies and gentlemen and GLTA
