This one isn’t for the retards on WSB this post is for the retards on Wall Street. The lack of vision currently on Wall Street has given me hope, it has given me hope that one day I will fuck these guy’s wives in order of how short sighted they are, in descending order (most shortsighted guys wife gets fucked first). 


Palantir has been through the ringer, bashed to shit and compared to this company called Snowflake over and over again. For months, retards like myself have been saying they’re completely different and that Palantir is in a league of its own. What does Palantir do? I have no fucking clue but whatever it is they do they do it better than Snowflake and whoever else does it. You can tell by Karps hair which company is superior. These absolute retards on Wall Street decide to ignore Karps hair in some sort of weird defiance and bets against this mans doo, well guess what? Life doesn’t work like that, imagine betting against Einstein because you didn’t like his hair. Retards, the lot of them. 


If DataRobot is partnered with Snowflake, and for some reason institutions are googly eyed about snowflake and it’s capabilities then why the fuck did DataRobot have to partner with Palantir?
