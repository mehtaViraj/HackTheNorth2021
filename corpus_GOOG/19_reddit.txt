The DoJ's Antitrust Division has yuge, beautiful, enormous statutory powers. These powers are vested by a few laws, the Sherman Antitrust Act, the Clayton Antitrust Act, and the FTC Act. The guys over at Antitrust occasionally like to joke that the FTC has unconstitutional powers. The Antitrust Division has to run everything they want to do through the courts-*even the voluntary settlements they make with businesses*.

The Antitrust runs criminal collusion cases, which don't apply here, and civil litigation.

The Antitrust Division is alleging that Google constitutes a monopoly (which they claim in their complaint), but then they undermine their own argument with market dominance arguments. The reason they do this is because you can't break up a dominant player in a market, but you can break up a monopoly. The DoJ's case is weaker than your wife after she's been with her boyfriend.

The case is bad publicity, and the legal costs are going to be high. GOOG will be fine.
