Google hitting breakthroughs in quantum computing, this technology will revolutionize the server/datacenter market.

IBM is also a leader in the race to develop a working quantum computer, so they might be a good long term investment if they continue to make sizable improvements on this technology

Update: Just took a look at the pdf published to NASA - here's an important takeaway:

"On Google Cloud servers, we estimate that performing the same task for m = 20 with 0.1% fidelity using the SFA algorithm would cost 50 trillion core-hours and consume 1 petawatt hour of energy. To put this in perspective, it took 600 seconds to sample the circuit on the quantum processor 3 million times, where sampling time is limited by control hardware communications; in fact, the net quantum processor time is only about 30 seconds."
