So who do you think has the best chance at getting the Autonomous cars first?.. its basically like when cars went from Manual to Automatic.

my money is on GOOGLE car ðŸš— with all my money in year long F calls. Google is the top company in AI research and its tensorflow image recognition is learning more every day.

MSFT will flop like they did with the windows phone and the tiktok merger plan.. MSFT has a long list of being late to the party like with Zune.. i might buy their Microsoft car though cause they always dot their T's and cross their I's.

Your Thoughts.. please share!
