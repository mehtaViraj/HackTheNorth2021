I feel like Apple has been so complacent with their products. Really the only cool product theyâ€™ve released in the last several years has been their AirPods and AirPods Pro. Phones? Same shit different year, people will buy the phones regardless of the specs and the features. Same goes for their line of MacBooks. 

Apple has had so much time and so much extra cash they could have easily expanded their cloud infrastructure to become competitors with GOOG, MSFT, and even AMZN on e-commerce. What the fuck is Tim Cuck doing?
