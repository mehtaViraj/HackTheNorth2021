Researchers [publish a study](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3776874) which mathematically proves that WSB is indeed completely retarded. Purely by coincidence, on the exact same day, GME starts to dump. 8 million retards cry out in confusion. Must be a short step ladder attack or something.
