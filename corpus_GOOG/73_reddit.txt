I’ve been on this thread nonstop lately, advocating (don’t sue me ;)) y’all to get into this bad boy. The fundamentals are all there: a cutting edge tech unicorn with robust sales, earnings on deck, and unparalleled potential.

The ownership from institutions is otw as well. We all know Cathie Wood has tripled down in the last week, and recently, big banks like JP Morgan are confirming previous stakes in PLTR.

This is FB/GOOG in the waiting, but I believe it will soar like Tesla. Indeed, the monetary policy conditions right now are extremely conducive to mega cap tech companies getting grounded EXTREMELY FAST, see this provoking WSJ graphic on the topic

I think PLTR’s days in the $20 range are numbered. One can hem about valuations all day, but tell me why obsolete Snowflake is trading at 80X sales, and we can have an intelligent discussion.

If we (the market not WSB) believe Tesla, Snowflake, and Shopify are not a joke, than PLTR is grossly UNDERVALUED. I have to imagine smart money isn’t too far behind my thinking.
