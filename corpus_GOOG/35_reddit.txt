$BURL P/E 26.69 - Profit Margin - 6.06% (Worse than peers Ross & TJ Maxx) - Quarterly Revenue Growth 7.20%$FB P/E - Profit Margin 33.17% - Quarterly Revenue Growth 26%$GOOG P/E 26.00 - Profit Margin - 19.71% - Quarterly Revenue Growth 16.70%

Is it just me or does this seem totally out of whack to you? Retail is dying, yet $BURL is up 463% in last 5 years and has a P/E higher than Facebook and Alphabet. Clearly $BURL isn't dying - yet. It's actually doing great - for now. I think its sales are just benefitting from more low-income people having jobs and blindly expanding and moving their stores, both of which will be unsustainable during the next crash.

Yet investors are pricing this company like a high growth tech stock. Burlington Coat Factory has minimal digital presence and no plans to expand its digital presence. Executives are old guys from other department stores that have gone down the drain. No influencer marketing or coolness among young people. Surely it can't sustain its current growth and will get pummeled in the next crash right?

Completely new to this subreddit and new to trading, thought you guys could roast me on this because it's clearly contrary to what the pros think and I'm probably missing something.
