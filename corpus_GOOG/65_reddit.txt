Google market cap is $817b
Wal-Mart is $245b
JD is $62b
Flipkart about $20b
Amazon is $836b

Does Google (Alphabet) go in and aquire Wal-Mart? They would control the two biggest foreign markets and allow Wal-Mart to compete with Amazon. The marketing and advertisements and potential is huge. There are a ton of synergies already but it would make perfect sense if Google bought Wal-Mart and cheap for valuation. 

Walmart’s total revenue for the last fiscal was over $500 billion, while Amazon’s net sales were $177.9 billion. Walmart showed net income of over $20 billion, while Amazon’s net income was $3 billion. Yet, Amazon today is among the top five companies in the world in terms of market capitalisation at over $680 billion market cap. 

Why outright aquire them? Access to all markers with a stronghold. And data. Lots of data. 

Amazon has a decent shot at this, given how deeply it understands your purchase history. Google? Not so much, at least not before the Walmart deal. Google Express already partners with some big names—including Costco and Walgreens—but has such a negligible market share that it can’t reliably know what you want, when you want it.

Alphabet Inc.’s Google unit is investing $550 million in Chinese online retailer JD.com Inc., a move that will deepen its ties with China and ramp up its rivalry with Amazon.com Inc.

Walmart’s acquisition plan for Flipkart will likely involve Google’s parent Alphabet taking a minority stake in India’s largest ecommerce company, said people with knowledge of the matter. Alphabet will probably invest $1-2 billion after the Walmart acquisition, expected to be announced shortly, they added. Walmart said earlier this month it will pay $16 billion for a roughly 77 percent stake in Flipkart, the U.S. retailer's largest-ever deal.
