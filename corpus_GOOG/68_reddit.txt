Alexa is dumb as shit. Google has shown to be more adept at turning a profit than Amazon. GOOG doesn't have key man risk the way amazon does. Advertising will continue to grow and it's pretty obvious you get more eyeballs from GOOG ads than Amazon ads. As much as the EU hates google, it hates Amazon even more. AWS faces a serious challenger in Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure. Google's search model is pretty much untouchable. Google has the stronger franchise.

I could go on and on...

Fight me.
