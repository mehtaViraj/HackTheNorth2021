Huawei is second largest phone manufacturer across both iOS and Android. They're on record to overtake Samsung by the end of 2020 according to some report I read a while back.

Huawei has also been reported to developing it's own operating system for a while now, which isn't much of an issue to android, but it's still something worth noting. Plus, let's not forget that if this does go through, any future Huawei phone won't have access to the playstore = less revenue. It's a fucking mess if this actually happens.
