Retards - fellow retard here. Agree with everyone that we are fucked beyond belief, but fundamentals don't matter and don't fight the BRRR. Seeing as recession is cancelled and boomers call the shots, what are people's thoughts on January 2021 Google calls ATM. Literally just has to expire at it Feb peak and you double your money... Amazon is already back to its peak, Goog is probably close behind. 10k bet for one call. Am I as retarded as my wife's boyfriend says I am?
