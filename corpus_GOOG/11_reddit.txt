Just had a friend tell me his Google AdSense account was recently un-banned after being banned for 6+ years. Anyone who knows AdSense knows they NEVER lift bans... EVER.... for pretty much ANY reason... much less 6+ years later for no reason.

They are BEYOND hurting for revenue if they're opening back up banned AdSense accounts. They were banned for a reason... mostly click fraud, but in general, these accounts were flagged as posing a danger to their advertisers (either malware, spyware, click fraud, lead fraud, impression fraud, suspect or lacking content, etc). This could be a short-term boon to their revenues, but *definitely* poses a long-term danger to the rates Google can charge. Mostly though, the fact they are even taking this course of actions means they are *needing* to scrape the bottom of the barrel for every bit of revenue they can find.... even if it's less than "legitimate" and not good long-term for them *or* their advertisers. 

Not sure if this dip will be reflected in Q1, but look the fuck out come Q2...
