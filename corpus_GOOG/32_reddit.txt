This happened roughly 4 hours ago from making this post and the new terms go into effect June 1st. 

I really think this is huge for GOOG/GOOGL ad revenue. According to socialblade, there are 56 million channels under 1k subs(10-999) as of November 13 2020. Youtube previously demonetized smaller channels but I guess is going all in.

From Youtube: "YouTube’s right to monetize: YouTube has the right to monetize all content on the platform and ads may appear on videos from channels not in the YouTube Partner Program."

With GOOG's stock rising $600 EPS over the past 6 months and with this, I almost see nothing that can stop tremendous ad revenue and a moderate EPS during Q3 earnings call.
