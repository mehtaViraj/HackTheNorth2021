**AAPL**

People love to say that AAPL has $100B+ in cash, but they actually have $40B in cash equivalents, and $67B in "marketable securities."  What are "marketable securities"?

From their latest [10-Q](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019320000010/a10-qq1202012282019.htm):

>The maturities of the Companyâ€™s non-current marketable debt securities generally range from one to five years.

Of this $67B in marketable securities, **nearly $55B is non-current corporate debt** (Source: "Note 3 - Financial Instruments").

Is AAPL a Boeing debt holder?  A GE debt holder?  A United Airlines debt holder?  We don't know.

From their latest [10-K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000101872420000004/amzn-20191231x10k.htm), $36B in cash equivalents, plus $12B in "corporate debt securities."  We don't know anything about the maturities of those corporate debt securities.

From the latest [10-K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204420000008/goog10-k2019.htm): $18B in cash equivalents, $101B in marketable securities, $13B in non-marketable securities (investments in  unicorns?) on the balance sheet.

What are "marketable securities"?

>As we view these securities as available to support current operations, **we classify highly liquid securities with maturities beyond 12 months as current assets** under the caption marketable securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  
>  
>Cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market funds, highly liquid government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities and marketable equity securities.

No additional breakdown of the marketable securities is provided.  Are they mostly corporate debt?  Treasuries?  We don't know.
