#ASTS is a satellite company which allows 5G internet/cell phone connectivity anywhere in the world **through your existing cell phone**. In short, ASTS represents an attractive asymmetric bet in the following ways:

* [**Space Launch Market Competition:** It seems every week there is a new article about how cheap launches are becoming due to increased competition. SpaceX, Blue Origin, \(among others\) have brought space into the mainstream and are allowing for repeatable launches. Billionaires are throwing away cash just to win some twitter space race. The question here is; who actually stands to gain from cheaper launches?

* **Customer Acquisition:** ASTS works with existing telecom providers and does not need to acquire customers, pay for marketing, or gain approval for spectrum usage. By signing with existing telcos, all ASTS needs to do is launch a (patent protected) satellite and collect a check.

* **5G Fund:** $9 Billion in government funds are in play for rural 5G expansion. AT&T is working with ASTS to gain access to this money. Microsoft believes ~157m Americans do not have access to broadband internet. ASTS solves this.

* **Sold off:** ASTS has been wrapped up in a space market correction without participants understanding the value this company adds. At current levels “you” are buying in below investors like Vodafone and Rakuten who have all vetted this company and have a vested interest in the company's success. American Tower is invested and is essentially hedging their business against the success of ASTS removing the need for Cell Phone towers. *Take a second to look at their chart (and thereby the proliferation of cell towers) and think of Satellites replacing their entire business structure.*

**What makes ASTS Different:**

&nbsp;

Iridium currently sits at a $5B market cap and allows for cell phone calls to be completed via satellite. This company serves maritime and oversees applications, charges customers by the minute (think cell phones circa 1999 or Roblucks(?) if you're the same high schooler) and requires a separate bulky headset. This is the difference maker for $ASTS, anyones existing smart phone can connect to their satellite as they rely on a larger high powered satellite vs IRDM which has a smaller satellite and relies on the headset to make up the difference. This same principle can be transferred to Starlink which has smaller satellite arrays and relies on a dish to connect.

&nbsp;

The average AST SpaceMobile satellite signal is powerful enough to penetrate two walls inside a building, the fuselage of an airplane, or the interior of a car or train. No direct line of sight is needed and the service is similar to that provided by a tower two to five kilometers away from a handset. The satellite architecture is completely different from that used in other systems. With each satellite providing coverage to a large area approximately 2,800km in diameter, a much smaller number of satellites are required to achieve global coverage compared to other systems and the constellation will be capable of supporting 5G speeds as defined by the FCC.

&nbsp;

AST SpaceMobile recently participated in the public comment period regarding the 5G Fund for Rural America. In October, the FCC formally moved to allow mobile-satellite providers that meet specified performance standards and other requirements to apply to participate with its partners in the 5G Fund auction as a 5G broadband provider. The 5G Fund will distribute up to $9 billion for 5G wireless broadband connectivity in rural America to close the digital divide.

&nbsp;


The first phase deployment of 20 satellites is expected in the second half of 2022 with coverage to 49 equatorial countries in 2023. ASTS plans to achieve full global mobile coverage with 110 satellites by the end of 2023 or early in 2024 with a total of 168 satellites by the end of 2024. Commercial service expected to be offered beginning in 2023 across 49 equatorial countries.
If ASTS proves to be successful IRDM would be an easy short ala long GOOG short YHOO.

&nbsp;

**What moat exists:**



[With 836 patent claims and growing](https://i.imgur.com/iTXb4VW.png), the company believes it has a five to seven-year first-mover advantage over competitors. A steep barrier to entry exists in the satellite space which these patents protect. ASTS CEO Abel Avellan has proven another satellite company Emerging Markets Communications which sold to Global Eagle for $550m. 

&nbsp;


Customers have already been established with ASTS. SpaceMobile service will be initially offered to 1.3 billion users. Vodafone has a 50/50 revenue share agreement covering its markets. Millicom, LiLAC, TEF, AT&T (including Mexico) and TEO, among others, already have a memorandum of understanding with ASTS. All of these companies have done their own DD on the technology and have signed off on it. This isn’t a question of if it will work, but when. AT&T has signed on for the exclusive rights in the US. They think of this as a potential difference maker in carrier choice going forward *(think iPhone exclusivity that existed previously).*

&nbsp;



**What need is there:**

Management estimates that 90% of the planet's surface isn't reached by wireless networks. About 5.2 billion people move in and out of coverage as terrestrial towers frequently fail to reach distant areas. There are 3.3 billion people without wireless data connectivity and another 0.7 billion with no cellular coverage whatsoever.

&nbsp;

In middle America broadband speeds are lacking as is cellular connectivity. This is why the government is looking to make advances in 5G quickly. Microsoft believes ~157m Americans do not have access to broadband internet.

&nbsp;


**Addressable Market and Costs:**

Cost of the service estimates for final users living in emerging markets could be as low as $2.06/month. Currently, carriers spend 80% of their capex serving 20% of their traffic in remote areas. ASTS could significantly reduce the amount of capex needed to serve unconnected areas.

&nbsp;


The development efforts to date and the equatorial project should cost $510M and the global constellation a further $1.3B of additional capex. ASTS projects to generate revenues in 2023 and become cash flow positive by 2024.

&nbsp;

With as little as 9 million users in emerging markets SpaceMobile expects to generate $181M in revenues and $130M in EBITDA by 2023E. Once phases 2 and 3 are completed, revenues and EBITDA would shoot up to $1.07B and $1.0B in 2024. At this point the company would generate enough cash flow to pay for its future expansion.

&nbsp;


**This doesn't fit anywhere:**

The Barclays Managing Director who did the due diligence for ASTS merge, Scott Wisniewski, left his job to joins ASTS as their Chief Strategy Officer. This mans job was doing DD on space companies and he left for $ASTS options.


&nbsp;


**Potential Catalysts:**

Research Coverage Initiated: As of now no price targets have been set for ASTS. Research coverage being initiated could result in a positive reaction for the stock. This was what set SPCE on a run (which this sub participated in) in January 2020.


Blue Walker 3: As of now the proof of concept launch used a satellite on the ground connecting to a phone in space. Q4 of this year will be the launch of their test satellite. A successful launch and test would mean the business will be able to go through Phase 1 and become cash flow positive. Someone much smarter than me will tell you what that is worth in terms of stock price. 

&nbsp;

**TL:DR** Max Bid ASTS Walk Away. Space internet on a toilet anywhere in the world.
