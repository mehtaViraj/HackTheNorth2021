I bought some $BIDU calls Fri because A) I meant to buy $GOOG calls but I'm too dyslexic to read so my dragon is typing this for me B) they were cheap for a few hours C) if $GOOG earnings are strong $BIDU could/should get some help as long as Trump keeps his mouth shut about China for the day and D) $BIDU is the better Buffet long play anyway and they look cheap compared to $GOOG when considered fucking China doesn't even have wifi yet.

I'd still like to hear what you retards think about $GOOG today. I got some bio money just begging to YOLO into another play today if something looks promising enough. If it dips hard enough I'll probably buy Jun or July calls.
