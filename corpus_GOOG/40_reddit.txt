So y'all have been asking for an  easy, can't-possibly-fuck-it-up type of trade, especially after the  $ISRG debacle.  I don't usually like writing up about companies with  more than half-trillion dollar market caps, but I'll make an exception  just this once because it doesn't get any easier than this trade,  especially with our newfound policy of kissing China's feet rather than  trying to piss them off.  So let's talk about Alibaba ($BABA)

# Who they are, in case you've been living under a rock

$BABA  is basically the result of if you combined $AMZN, $JPM, $SHOP, $PYPL,  and $GOOG (not $GOOGL, no voting rights in China).  Over 90% of China's  online shopping goes through one of their portals, mostly Taobao on the  consumer side and the flagship Alibaba site for B2B.  Oh, and they've  even started building out their own cloud platform, because China can  never just come up with an idea on their own, they have to copy a  competitor (i.e. Amazon).  If you think Amazon is pervasive, they're  bush league compared to this company.  In short, the only thing bigger  than China's $BABA is deceased WWF pornstar Chyna's clit (still too  soon?).

Anecdotally,  they're also where savvy US consumers go to buy $1500 DJI Phantom 4  drones for like 400 bucks (and no, they're not knockoffs).

# Peering over the Great Wall:

&#x200B;

Their over 600 billion dollar market  cap makes them the 7th largest company on the exchange, just behind  $TSLA and just above Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger.  Unlike the  company just ahead of them, they actually make money, though.  They do  about 72 billion dollars in revenue annually and, when they're not  pissing off the communist party and being handed down massive fines as  an alternative to their founder being disappeared to go hang out with  the Uyghurs in a slave camp making textiles, they pocket about 12  billion of that 72 as net revenue.  They make their money by selling ad  space to merchants as opposed to $AMZN's method of "taking 1/3 of all  the money you make for giving you a buy button on the site" and, as  recently as 2019, had grand designs about moving in to the US space and  taking on $AMZN head-on with a merchant agreement of a one-time  admission fee in exchange for commission free commerce.  I could write  an entire thesis just on their various revenue streams.  Everything from  ecommerce to a search engine to their own fucking (**DUMB FILTER ALERT:**  automod doesn't like the 4 letter word for a place you go to deposit your money and get checks so we'll call them) tanking ecosystem  (which they unsuccessfully tried to spin off into its own entity last  year, thoroughly pissing off Winnie the Pooh and momentarily distracting  him from peaceably seizing Hong Kong by killing all the citizens there.

Interestingly,  as a result of their mini argument with the technocommunist leadership  over a failed attempt to IPO the Ant Financial Group, which $BABA owns  1/3 of, $BABA represents one of the few large cap stocks you can trade  in the US that isn't presently sitting near an all-time high (20% off,  in fact), as people - including myself - avoided the company while  waiting to see what China was going to do with them.  Then others have  been apprehensive to jump back into because, apparently, it's more fun  to lose all your money betting on a shitty Chamath scam that rips off  Medicare or a LIDAR company down 97% from its ATH and who makes less  gross revenue in a quarter than I paid for my last car (tragically, I'm  not even joking).

As  a result of this depressed price action, $BABA represents something of a  unique animal on Wall Street:  An ultra cap growth stock that is also  technically a value stock.  Just don't tell them they're a unique animal  or else the citizenry will storm their headquarters looking to kill  everyone and eat them because they think it'll bring them luck or make  their dicks bigger.  I usually stay away from this statistic, but for  once it's actually worthwhile to mention:  They only trade at 26 times  forward earnings.  In case you were wondering, $AMZN is more than 3  times that.

&#x200B;

# So what's their problem?

&#x200B;

 

I've already said:  It's China as a  whole.  All Chinese companies trade at a discount in America for a  number of reasons.  The primary reason is because you can never tell if a  company is actually being honest about its books, its revenues, or if  it's even a company.  For example, longtime followers will know that I  have maintained for quite some time that I'm not positive that the  company "Same Ole Shit" is even a real company.  Why?  Because there's  no oversight.  Also, there's no shorting over there, so everybody gets  away with making shit up.  One of the largest companies on their  exchange was found to be 2 guys in a van that parked behind a  hand-pulled noodle shop and who's sum assets were 2 laptops and some web  development software.  This is why, in general, I don't fuck with any  Chinese stocks and only make exceptions for $BABA, $BIDU, and $NIO (and  I'd do $YUMC if not for the fact I ignore that whole sector).   But  mostly, it's because if the regulators across the pond took aim at $BABA  once, there's always a chance they could do it again if Jack Ma forgets  his place.  The 2.8 billion dollar fine they got handed down sounds  really heavy, but it was really a best case scenario for this company.   Had that fine been handed down during any other time than now when the  market is in hard mode, $BABA likely would already be sitting in the  280's right now.

# So how does the Tendieman come?

Expected  47% YOY growth, with strong forward guidance going in to 2022.  Also,  now that President Harris is making nice nice simping for China again,  as soon as we re-open, expect them to start the process of moving in to  the US market, which will both simultaneously decimate Amazon's 3rd  party network while bolstering $BABA's own.  Oh, and they're encroaching  upon Lazada's turf throughout the rest of SE Asia, as well.

But  there's a catch:  Because Jack had to go to a re-education camp for a  few months and the company was forced to lay low waiting for Poohbear to  finish throwing his temper tantrum, there's still a bit of a fog into  the company right now that is not likely to be cleared up until they  report their next earnings late May.   Don't worry, I have it on good  authority that $BABA's network of merchants has been able to secure a  reliable supply of child labor to continue making all the goods they  sell.

#  Some basic TravelCenters of America just because (even though it's not terribly important for the thesis)

So  this one is going to look a little different than what I usually put  up, cause I figure some of you are ready for some more advanced  concepts.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pz1r53hj9bw61.jpg?width=1388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=631e23902505c2d7cf90f7e03e806067307c08f1

As  always, nude line is a 200 day SMA, dark blue is a 50 day SMA, and cyan  is a 20 day EMA.  Red lines represent the wedge that's important for  all of you for the purposes of understanding that it's approaching a  breakout point that is almost 100% to the upside, green represents some  channels that we'll talk about some other time, and the lavender is a  bastard fib fan of strike points based on the action (typically you use  those in a slightly different manner, but that's for another day and  another time.  I'm going to start gradually adding Travelcenters of  America markers in an effort to grow your little minds a bit.  So  consider this a level up.

&#x200B;

TL:DR:  Look in the red wedge.  We're  coming up to a head in that pattern, and it will be right around the  time they report earnings.  Look at all the other pretty colors and see  if a wrinkle doesn't develop.

One other thing we can look at is price to fair value.  This is a Morningstar chart, I didn't make it myself.

&#x200B;

So there are a couple of things I  want to call out here.  One is, obviously, the fact that this stock is  wildly undervalued according to every reasonable metric.  The other one  is a term that I want you guys to start learning called ***"Economic Moat"***.   The smoothbrain definition of that is basically a company's ability to  lie, cheat, sabotage, or buy out any competition in order to ensure  that they maintain a competitive advantage, no matter what.  Wide moats  are good but rather rare.  Obviously, if you read the "who are these  people" section, you know that $BABA has perhaps the widest moat of any  company on earth, because not only are they alone, but the barrier of  entry to challenge them is enormous.  Just ask their main competition,  $JD, who takes 1 step forward and 8 steps back every time they try.

# So, to summarize:

* Absolute  monster of a company 20% off its highs because of a combination of  government interference, continued concern over regulatory fuckery, and  the fact that nobody trusts the books of a Chinese company
* Over 90% of their market is penetrated, and they have aggressive expansion plans abroad
* Presently at a value level ***today*** as a result of them still being fairly fresh out of their hand slap for the shit they pulled
* I expect some DJI drones sent to my PO box after you make tendies on this
* Reports  late May; is very much a 2nd half of the year play - don't expect a ton  of movement in May up until earnings.  But volatility is already low.

# Price Targets:

For  once, I actually agree with pretty much every analyst out there.  This  company should be in the 320-330 range, and I think as we enter the 2nd  half of the year, you'll see a strong climb toward that.

&#x200B;

#  How do you play it?

**LEAPS ONLY!**  If you look at the daily chart, it had a bit of a pop after they got  fined, but has been largely flat money lately as nobody has wanted to  exit out of their positions due to it being undervalued, but not a lot  of demand to get IN to the position due to the overall market conditions  as a whole.  July at the earliest, August if you have the powder to pay  the extra premium.  If you look back up at my chart, I've gone with a  peanut butter spread strategy with this one, buying calls at $260, $270,  $280, and $310 (now do those lines make sense?) one month apart from  one another starting in August and running through November, along with  some existing June 18 240's just because I felt like it.

Remember,  it's perfectly fine to let this one sit a bit before entering into a  position, but your cost basis will be roughly the same, regardless.  At  the time of this writing, it's sitting at 235.  If you look at the chart  above, there's a real good chance you can creep in some positions after  it hits 230, because at some point I think it will come in to that  number.  However, if it drives to 230 hard, I want you to let it  consolidate and see if you can't get it even lower - maybe even 224 if  you can catch it on a really bloody red day.  But don't fuck around too  much, this isn't a lot of slippage given the equity price.

One  thing people have been asking me periodically is how I would rank the  companies I've talked about thus far on the premise that they don't have  enough powder to be in all the plays and were looking to see if I would  abandon one play for another.  I don't want to encourage that overall  (I don't want to encourage messaging me at all, really), but this once  I'll say that I would definitely not give up my $CLNE or $BE trades for  this one yet, as I don't expect this one to move for a while and those  green plays represent significantly more upside.  I wouldn't give up the  $NVTA trade if I was way underwater on it.  If I wasn't, I might  consider it.  I'd definitely give up cruise ships and plane engines.   Semis in June would be a personal choice.  I'd bail on the Devil's Gold  companies I talk about, I'd bail  on $BB, and the other trades are kind  of dead, anyways.

&#x200B;

#  Position Disclaimers:

Some  of you may have seen me talking about how I'm rebalancing my portfolio  for May and exiting out of all but 15 of my long positions in  preparation to enter into 35 short positions due to market conditions  and timing.  $BABA is one of the 15 stocks I do plan on holding my longs  on.  Liquidity in August has been difficult for me to get, so I'm only  sitting on 200 of those, the September 270 is really where I think the  sweet spot is and I've presently got 1900 of them and will be looking to  expand that, I have 2500 October 280's and the November 310 is a long  term FD that I'm sitting on 700 of.  I also have a significant amount of  shares in the company, but I've had them since their IPO and they are  sitting in managed assets, so not relevant to this trade.

There you have it, kids.  Go forth, and tendie-ize.

All my love
