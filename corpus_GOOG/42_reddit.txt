I bought GOOG way too high like an idiot when RSI was above 70. I’ve averaged down on the dips, but I’m still looking at about a $6k loss right now. 

If I sell GOOG for a $6k loss and immediately replace it with GOOGL, will that be considered a wash sale? Or would I get to account for the $6k loss while simultaneously getting to keep essentially the same position open?
