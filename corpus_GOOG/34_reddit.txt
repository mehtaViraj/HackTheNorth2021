Sup retards? wish to take a break from memes and check real trade? you got to the right place.

\*i might or might not change your life, or atleast your account balance.

today i will be writing about alibaba stock "BABA" and exlplain my thesis regarding the underlying.

# intro:

Alibaba Group Holding Limited operates various segments including : core commerce, cloud, digital media, entertainment, payment services...

business which Alibaba group own: Taobao, TMALL, Freshipo, Lazada, Ali-express, Alibaba, ele,me, 1688, youku, alibaba-cloud, alimama, cainiao network, dingtalk, ant group, ali-pay

Alibaba group does business in almost every thing you can imagine, therfore you can compare them to every big tech you know, they stand with the big dogs.(AMZN, GOOG, AAPL, MSFT) but they get less attention at the moment.  i think the sentiment towards alibaba is bound to change, very soon.

**Why BABA ?, why now ?**

baba showed negative performance relative to the other tech stocks at the moment (market sentiment due to politics - alot of impact on the stock) . but baba strength can be seen in a few areas: revenue growth, solid financial position with reasonable debt and very reasonable and cheap valuation. the profit margins are lower when comparing to peers right now but baba business have much to grow and much to be expected to fix that issue.

Baba stock experienced little decline in most recent quarter in comparison to performance from same quarter a year before, but i think the next earning this year will reveal growth in EPS.

Now, lets start of with the basics and take a look on baba financial and valuation.

so looking at valuations:

Mkrt value:  573B

p/e: \~25x

Fp/e: \~21x

p/s: \~5.2x

p/b: \~3.9x -> very attractive at this rate !

eps(ttm): 8.48

eps(ntm): \~12

next e/r : Aug 19

At BABA current stock price of $211, the market is expecting revenue to grow at 48.8% for the next 1 years. Over this period, BABA is also expected to generate an average Economic Earnings Margin of 13.8%

Baba have increased theirlong term debt looking at their financials but due to increase in future revenue i believe it is nothing to be bothered by. debt is not an real issue to baba.

\*\*very important note is that comparing baba to other big techs valuations at the moment proves that baba is dirty cheap and can be a good short/long term play . even is market goes sideways i dont see baba going any lower than right now. 200 price is pretty strong ressitence and still a good price.

revenue growth: 47.96%

eps growth : 14.42%

i will be including a look into baba Assets and Liabilities, which i believe is showing us a healthy company which keep growing and expanding and inceasing their cashflow, revenue and shareholders equity.

## Liabilities:

# Technicals:

52wk High: 319.32

52wk Low: 204.39

Avg volume (3M) : 15.8M -> breakout will increase volume obiously everybody watching the stock movement right now.

baba is down \~33% from the top at 319.32 (10/27/21).

I expect to see a bullish breakout in a couple days, can be happening anytime right now. good support at 209-210 level, every time we get there i can spot large money flowing into baba.

I believe that a price of 300$ before the year ends is possible and quite easy with a very little catalyst or sentiment change towards the company. right now from what im reviewing the sentiment towards baba is starting to chagne across the internet and financial market.
