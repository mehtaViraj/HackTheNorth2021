The mass market for battery electric vehicles is now set for the near future.

In one corner is Fisker:

[Fisker, Foxconn Firm Up Plan For Sub-$30,000 EV, Target U.S. Production In 2023](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2021/05/13/fisker-foxconn-firm-up-plan-for-sub-30000-ev-target-us-production-by-late-2023/?sh=7abee1c26b1c)

Excerpt:

> The companies signed an agreement for the so-called Project PEAR (an acronym for personal electric automotive revolution) Thursday and said they intend to sell the small, five-passenger vehicle with a starting price below $30,000. The two companies are jointly investing in the project and collaborating to ensure they can deliver a relatively low-cost, easy-to-build vehicle.

And:

> The new vehicle will be smaller than the Ocean and likely be available in a shorter-range version, with a smaller battery pack, to reach the under-$30,000 price level, and a pricier long-range version, Fisker said, without elaborating. The goal is to make more than 250,000 units of the new vehicle at assembly sites in the U.S. and overseas.

In another corner is Tesla, planning to roll out what will likely be the Model 2:

Excerpt:

> In order to be able to produce its most affordable product, the carmaker will be relying on its new and cheaper battery technology which was previewed in September last year, at its ‘Battery Day’ event.

And:

> Production of the newly designed battery packs will commence in 2022, and if Tesla’s claims come true, the Model 2 could have a highly competitive range, since Musk has earlier stated that a range of 250 miles (402 km) is “unacceptably low”.

Yet in another corner is electric vehicle maker Volkswagen, armed not just with the first mass market EV - the ID.3 - but with more models in the works in its push to become the next market leader in consumer-targeted battery EVs.  Already, it is the only auto manufacturer to provide software updates on a broad basis to customers.
