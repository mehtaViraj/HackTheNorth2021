 Hello  everyone! So I was analyzing the trending stocks on reddit on the past  week and I figured out I might just do a post for you guys regarding my  analysis. Keep in mind that this specific tool does not track some  stocks, for instance $WISH, because of the way it is build.

So, this week's most mentioned stocks:

I  noticed some growth compared to the previous week in TSLA, SPCE and  JPM. With regard to TSLA, we can see that the sentiment is positive, but  going south for the past days:
