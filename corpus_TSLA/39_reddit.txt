I’ve been investing in Tesla since May 2019 at under $200/share pre-split. A year ago, I got introduced to options and decided to try it out. I got hugely lucky with timing. Here are my option plays that gave me the biggest returns (I had other smaller wins and a few small losses):

Jan 15 171C **$11,400 -&gt; $585,650**

Mar 16 $150C **$15,780 -&gt; $297,675**

Mar 19 $240 **$17,160 -&gt; $774,300**

**Total $44,340 -&gt; $1,657,625**  


I exercised these all early.

UPDATE 1: 
FAQs since y’all ask the same god damn questions 
- Why exercise instead of sell the contracts and just buy the shares? Because they were so in the money I would have had to pay massive short term capital gains taxes. 
- when did you buy the contracts? 9-12 months ago. 
- do you still believe in TSLA? Yes, it’s my biggest holding. It’s the most innovative company of our lifetime and will probably be the world’s most valuable company before the end of the decade. 
- will you teach me options? No, read/watch everything you can to learn. 
- what options are you buying right now? Basically none, all you degenerates have driven up the premiums and there are few good deals. I buy shares and I sell options on occasion. Only ~5% of my portfolio is options. 
- what stock should I buy right now with my $38? I don’t give financial advice. Read my post history to see what I’m buying and decide if you like any of the ideas.

To all the dudes Messaging me: follow me if you want to know my next play. I’m not going to Message it to the 250+ people who messaged me tonight. 

To all the ladies sliding into my messages: thanks for the kind notes. I like volunteering with puppies, sunset walks on the beach, and getting cat-fished.
