Sold some TSLA shares so I could throw the cash into options for 8/20/21. I bought 11@$710. I really think AI Day will pump the stock back to at least $710 from last week, as the recent news of government inquiry has stirred ALOT of FUD this week. 

Or it could be another battery day, and all the dumb retail investors will panic when they read their physical newspapers that say everything is bad, when in reality the news is good. If that happens, I just chalk it up to another one of my many options' failures (I haven't had one hit yet, except for covered calls).

What do you think, did I just throw away my money?
