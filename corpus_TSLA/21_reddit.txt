A big trade idea, a little longer term and a rare opportunity for something huge. So first off, I've been in this trade since Friday, and my fault for not at least posting before this morning, I meant to finish writing this last night. But it's a longer term strategy and one day should not derail the overall goal. 

So here's the deal. I've been waiting on this trade almost all of this year.  I rarely trade TSLA or popular meme stocks in general. But there's a trade setting up that is similar to the rolling QQQ trade from 2020. First I want to say this trade only sees it's true potential when there's a prolonged move for an asset in either direction at almost a straight line, which is very rare in equities. 

Taking a step back, another requirement for this trade to come to fruition is that the general bull market in equities continues higher from this point. Length and magnitude don't have to be too large, but another couple months, and another 250 S&P points or so is required.  

With the backdrop of a continuing bull market, by which the case can be made for many reasons I won't go into here, and what I'm about to lay out, now is the time to enter an 8-10 week trade, using a **specific rolling weekly strategy on TSLA,** beginning this morning.

In parabolic bull markets, and specifically in individual names and leaders of those bull markets, proportional growth ratios become a big part of the price action leading into the acceleration phases. One can argue that TSLA itself is the clear leader of this particular bull market, the original meme stock flag-bearer, arguably sharing the title with the likes of AMD.

Taking an outside look at the growth patterns of TSLA's stock during this historic bull run, TSLA shows the most defined fractal pattern, indicating constant proportional growth near the ratio of the golden mean.. than any other leaders. And that makes sense given that it represents this bull market as a whole. Attached are some representations of this growth rate and it's respective pattern. It doesn't need to be complicated.

Given this rare setup, I think the rally to 900 will be almost linear and weekly call options beginning with 8/6 will return over 1000%. At which point **1/3 of total proceeds will be rolled into 8/13 before close Friday.**  This strategy will allow for the errant negative week to occur, or even two in a row.  The expected return on this trade by October end is in the order of 200x original trade size.  It sounds crazy.  I'll explain it more in a bit.



Given the set up has reached maturity, and with the assumption that the S&P continues it's bull run over the next 8-10 weeks, and given whom I consider it's sister company leading this bull market, AMD, already made it's own linear run through all time highs.. as well as others like SQ approaching new highs today on acquisition news or NVDA's recent run to substantial new highs. I'm making the assumption that TSLA will continue it's bull run after a 6 month consolidation, and make new highs which by definition are above 900. 

I think the new rally will peak at about $1350. These are all signs & indications of a blow-off top phase of a general bull market that could last any range of timeframes, but as we've seen some of the most amazing moves in equities can happen during these times, and this trade hones in on one specific move that will be looked at in the context of a bigger picture when it's all said and done. The time and opportunity to make a trade like this is now.  More perfect would have been this morning. But if the thesis is right, the move will be nearly linear and there won't be many opportunities for a pullback.

**Enter for 8/6 to start the roll.   740c**

**Looking for TSLA to close the week out about $805**



Not sending this on Friday cost a bit on the initial entry, but 4% should not matter if the trade is correct.
