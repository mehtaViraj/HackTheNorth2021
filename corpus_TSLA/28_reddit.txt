This name is getting absolutely fooked by the suits.

Price action is wedging like crazy. Hanging on the tip and starting to coil. Historically, this stock tends to break out hard after wedging out.

Not to mention 10yr yields have dropped to 1.2% - which means megacaps run bc valuations matter less as investors hunt for yield.

There’s no way this name can get this beaten down and not reflexively bounce.

TSLA August 20 800c 3.45
TSLA September 1000c is only 1.56 (cheap imo)

It’s currently down .25 standard deviations intraday at 648. If there’s an entry, it’s right now. (7/22 @ 10:30am CDT)

Earnings next Monday after close

LFG!!!

Edit: I’m personally in TSLA 7/23 700c and 8/6 800c bc I’m degen. Recommending plays in post bc they make more sense
