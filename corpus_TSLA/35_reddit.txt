Elon has battled shorts for almost a decade. We all remember when he complained that shorting should be illegal, and when he released “short shorts” when he finally defeated them. 

But guess who used to brag about shorting Tesla? Gabe 🌈🐻 Plotkin. 

From [Bloomberg:](https://www.bloomberg.com./news/articles/2019-07-19/cohen-cub-gabriel-plotkin-sees-fund-surge-about-44-this-year)

Plotkin described Melvin as “a very human-intensive place. We have a lot of analysts, we require a lot out of them.” The team has modeled more than 500 companies in “significant detail,” while a data science group reads into trends.
He added that the firm has an “intense focus” on the short side, with about 70% of profits in Melvin’s first year coming from bearish bets. Plotkin expressed skepticism about mall real estate investment trusts, as well as electric-car maker Tesla Inc.

$GME to the 🌚, then profits back to a safe store of value: $TSLA.
