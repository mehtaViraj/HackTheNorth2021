Tesla Stock still has huge growth potential.

Listen up fellow apes. I will try to make this short and simple.  I believe TSLA is headed towards a $2T Market Cap.

&#x200B;

**PE Ratio**

The PE Ratio measures current share price relative to its per-share earnings. This reflects how much an investor is willing to pay for earnings.

For a company not rapidly expanding, a normal P/E ratio is around 20:1. The average PE for the S&P is something like 15.

We have all read about TSLA having an insanely high PE ratio in the past. That was before they started making over $1B per quarter.

Now the PE ratio is lower, but still very high.

TSLA is currently around a PE of 112 for forward earnings. The stock costs \~$650 per share. And the earnings per share were $1.45 for Q2.

So 650/ (1.45 x 4 quarters) = A forward PE of about 110.

(I am multiplying by the most recent Q2 and assuming the earnings are the same going forward for the sake of simplicity in this example)

Another way is to take annual earnings and the total market cap of the company. Their recent earnings were about $1.14B in Q2. So assume $4.56Billion for the next year.

$622B market cap / 4.56B annual earnings = PE ratio of \~135

This is with them making around 200,000 vehicles per quarter in Q2 2020. Or an annualized rate of just over 800,00 vehicles per year. Just doing an average of 1.14Billion / 200,000 gives us about $5,000 "per car". This ignores the energy sectors and software, solar, etc. Just a point of reference for an average.

**Future**

Does anyone expect Tesla to be standing still for the next few years?

Of course not.

With Berlin and Texas coming online, Tesla may reach 900,000 cars this year. In 2022 they will likely be well over 1.5million cars per year.  So let's assume that by 2024 they are making 3 million cars per year.

3,000,000 cars x $5,000 per car = $15Billion per year in earnings.

How about with $8,000 per car?

=$24Billion

$24Billion x 30 = $720Billion Market Cap

How about a PE ration of 50. Since this seems like something investors have had no trouble tolerating over the life of TSLA's stock.

$24B x 50 = $1.2T Market Cap.

&#x200B;

Let's try that again for 2028

Assume 6million cars per year and profits of $12,000 per car as efficiencies ramp up across all sectors.

This gives an annual earnings of $72B.

&#x200B;

((-Again, this sort of ignores the energy sector, software potential, etc.

\-Just the $10/month that Tesla charges for premium connectivity will become a high margin revenue generator. Around 2023 or 2024 Tesla will have about 5million cars on the road being charged the monthly cost.

$120/year x 5,000,000 cars = $600,000,000 per year in mostly profit.

\-The Supercharger costs to other Automakers could also become a huge revenue generator. ))

&#x200B;

**A PE ratio of 30 on $72B is $2.1T**

This would be a stock price around $2200 per share.

If Investors are willing to tolerate a higher PE, then the Market Cap could hit 2T much sooner.

&#x200B;

**Other Notes**

It is worth considering that if the stock gets into the Low $1,000s, Tesla may split it again. When it was announced last time there was a massive increase in the stock price before the split. It went from the low 1,000s to the mid $2,000s. The Mid $2,000s would be a Market Carp \~ $2T.

Edit: No matter what you think about 'FSD', it should be easy for everyone to accept that once Tesla gets FSD approved in a single jurisdiction, the stock will also jump through the roof. It doesn't matter if it will be in 2022, 2023, or 20XX, etc. I left that out since it is a whole separate discussion. And is not needed for my math of a $2T market cap.

Don't listen to me. Ignore my assumptions. Invest in Banana futures.
