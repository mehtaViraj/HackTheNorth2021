Is TSLA ready? I think it is. Even more so as it seems like 99% of traders are bearish and expecting a pullback. TSLA is a name I watch daily and closely but with patience. I used to trade it a lot more before its inclusion into S&P

Short term Gamma has it very bullish imo. Especially if price stays above 670. You can see the large gamma wall at 700 and really nothing until 750. 

When looking at Executed Put contracts and Open Interest on Put contracts, you can see there is really nothing above its current price. The fact that there isnt much Open Interest offered above tells me a big move is possibly coming.

When I look at my daily raindrop chart, rain drops are like volume profile candles, I see accumulation the past days then breakout today. Obviously would like to see continuation into tomorrow.
