What are your guys thoughts about TSLA and what is the reason for the bulls jumping on it? I personally like that stock, and I really want TSLA of 2020 back…. Fun days!!!

I always tell my friends that I believe in Elon, and whatever happens i will still believe in him. He might have manipulated the market, but who cares? People jumped on and held the bags. If you think about it, he made the smart traders so much with all the pumping

I have never posted here and it keeps telling me that my post is too short make it a comment, and when I comment, it says i don’t have enough karmas. Can someone please explain
