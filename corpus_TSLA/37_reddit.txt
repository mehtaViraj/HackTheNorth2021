Last year Elon Musk tweeted that "Tesla stock price is too high imo". Most people did not think too much of this as they thought he was referring to the then recent price action. However, when the 5 for 1 stock split happened in august later that year, some keen eyes noticed that he was actually referring to a split.

He tweeted it at 8:11am PT on 5/1. The 5 for 1 stock split was announced on 8/11.

So why do I think he is hinting at another split? There are a few clues on his twitter as well as several recent tweets that point at an upcoming 4 for 1 split next week on 6/23. First piece of evidence is a recent tweet about appealing to small audiences (i.e. retail investors).

Besides this tweet talking about appealing to small audiences, this was tweeted on 4/1. Similar to the last tweet, it was tweeted on the first of a month so it could possible refer to a 4 for 1 stock split. While this was tweeted at 3:23am PT, if you use the time zone that the markets are based on then it would be 6:23am EST which could be hinting at 6/23.

While this might not be enough evidence for some, there are a few other potential hints. First of all, he recently changed his name to "Elon Musk, the 2nd" which could be referring to the second stock split.

Furthermore, he has been tweeting some more cryptic tweets such as a recent talking about GME and AMC.

He could be referring to the sequel of the TSLA short squeeze. He has made fun of short sellers in the past and it would not be surprising if he is referring to an upcoming stock split as being the catalyst for this sequel.

Assuming that there is a stock split announced after market close next Wednesday on 6/23, calls could be a good play. Last stock split announcement saw a 13%+ rise the day after as well as an 80%+ rise between the announcement and the actual split which was roughly two weeks later.

Positions: TSLA 6/25 650C & TSLA 7/9 800C

TLDR; Elon Musk hinting at 4 for 1 stock split on 6/23. Load up on calls.
