The white house wants to renew the solar ITC by 10 yrs in their partisan budget reconciliation, which, for context, sent names higher by 50% the last time it was renewed 3 yrs in 2015. 

Tax credits are a huge tailwind for the solar industry, as it allows them to price more competitively, thereby increasing market size, and further reducing costs through economies of scale.

Most solar names have very high short interest, but my focus is in $RUN, which I like due to its fundamentals. $RUN has a 20% short interest, and a lot of its shares are held by passive holders (specifically Coatue and Tiger Global own 15% of the company). These guys didn't trim when the stock was at 90, so you can assume they won't sell in the event of a short squeeze. Keep in mind most $RUN PTs are in the 70-90s range, so i'm not sure there's much downside here to begin with. 

Anyways, if you believe the reconciliation bill has a chance of passing (as I do), in the next month there could be a very significant rise in $RUN $TAN and $TSLA
