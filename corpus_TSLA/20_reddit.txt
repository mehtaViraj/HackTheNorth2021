I have had friends and family irl tell me for the past 16+ months that $TSLA could go down. It is valued higher than $F or $GM or all the automakers combined or some shit.

The largest company in the world choose $TSLA batteries üîã on their new massive solar farm https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/04/01/apple-will-use-tesla-megapack-batteries-at-its-solar-farm-facility.html

$TSLA has partnered w utilities and municipalities and many not even announced https://www.eei.org/future/Pages/story.aspx?sid=8_Partners:%20Tesla%20and%20Southern

$TSLA GREW 162% YoY on installed solar https://www.pv-tech.org/tesla-solar-growth-continues-but-significant-mistakes-in-roof-assessments-holding-back-solar-roof-progress/

$TSLA delivered 184,800 vehicles Q1 2021 for a 109% increase YoY while there is a chip shortage https://www.pv-tech.org/tesla-solar-growth-continues-but-significant-mistakes-in-roof-assessments-holding-back-solar-roof-progress/

While everyone tries to figure out batteries $TSLA owns a fucking nickel island (I know it is a partnership) https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/business-56288781.amp

$TSLA is so far ahead of legacy automakers that VW is buying carbon fucking offsets from them https://www.tesmanian.com/blogs/tesmanian-blog/volkswagen-buys-carbon-credits-from-tesla

AI and data are the name of the game and the amount of miles driven and data complied doesn‚Äôt even really have a close competitor https://towardsdatascience.com/why-teslas-fleet-miles-matter-for-autonomous-driving-8e48503a462f

$TSLA is now scaling. It took 168 days to build üá®üá≥ Gigafactory. Berlin and TX soon and then India and then https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-23/elon-musk-opened-tesla-s-shanghai-gigafactory-in-just-168-days

$TSLA ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 52.92% last 6 months; ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 310.09% last year; ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 1,581.61% past 5 years.

There is much more.

$TSLA is basically an Index fund of EV, solar, AI, data, batteries, and more. $GM might be able to produce EV Hummer in 2023 for $110K+. $F just created a battery division and location. 

$TSLA is literally 10 years ahead of the competition. I will be placing an order for a Model Y Long Range this summer. 

Long over 100+ shares, Jan 2023 $500 LEAPS, $800 5/21 CCs, and a $540 July CSP.
