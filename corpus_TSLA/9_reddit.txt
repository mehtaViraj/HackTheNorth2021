It’s all contingent on them mastering FSD, but if they do, they win the Big Prize. 

[Loup](https://loupfunds.com/fsd-will-have-powerful-impact-on-tesla-profits/) thinks they can generate revenue of $1 Trillion/yr just on FSD subscriptions by 2031. 

[ARK](https://ark-invest.com/big-ideas-2021/) predicts robotaxi industry revenues of $6-7 Trillion/yr, with winners making $1T in profit by 2030. 

Thus I’ll predict Tesla revenues of $3T in ten years. They are expected to earn about $50B this year, sixty times less. Ten years out, it seems pointless to predict margins and whatever else, so I’ll just multiply today’s price by 60. 

Price in 2031: $43,200
