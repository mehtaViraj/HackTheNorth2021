So, I’m just reading about Panasonic’s completion of selling its TSLA stake for almost $4b. It seems like this was reported Friday and the sales concluded in March.

$4b is a ton of selling to do, and I’m wondering if that artificially depressed TSLA’s stock during March. And if we are seeing a bounce back now that the selling pressure is gone…

Overall, I am bearish on TSLA for multiple reasons, but for folks who are bullish on TSLA, I think getting that $4b sale absorbed and in the rear view mirror would be a good thing for TSLA stockholders. And it means a lot of the selling pressure in March wasn’t really price discovery and speculators, but a major corporate shareholder exiting its position. 

Thoughts? Is this at all anything that matters? Or in the face of a $650B market cap, does a $4b sale not make a difference?
