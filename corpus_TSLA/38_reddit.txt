Loaded these up all day yesterday. Unfortunately my wife's boyfriend wouldn't give me anymore money towards end of day when it bled out to $8 cost. I managed to buy at $17, $16, $13, $12 and ran out of money.

I closed out my position at the open as planned at $25 (highest of day was $26.10) Ended up 52% profit cause remember I was down -50% last week cause I bought the top like a retard.

I scalped the ranges throughout the day with calls and puts to practice.

Towards the end I got a bit excited with the sell off to $690 and meant to load up on 700 calls again BUT I accidently fucking bought $710 calls 4/9 instead
