Months ago I told you that... 

"Ford is headquartered in the battleground state of Michigan. Michigan was won by Obama, Trump, and Biden, so there is political pressure to award larger government contracts and funding to Ford. Tesla, on the other hand, has its HQ in California. While Tesla will still earn contracts and funding, it's more politically appealing to work with Ford. For example, Biden has already driven the new Ford Lightning pick-up truck. Tell me the last time you remember a president doing a 0-60 pull in an electric vehicle manufactured by Tesla."

Today, Biden is hosting an event regarding the transition to electric vehicles.  Ford and GM were invited.  Tesla wasn't.  This is a shame because Tesla is a great company, but my theory still holds.  Tesla will get funding, but they won't get all the positive PR that Ford and GM will get.

Also, I was listening to Bloomberg live this morning and they confirmed that Tesla was not invited.

Fun fact... During Tesla's Q2 earnings call, even Elon had to acknowledge that the only two car manufactures to not go bankrupt were Ford and Tesla.

Don't sleep on Ford. $F
