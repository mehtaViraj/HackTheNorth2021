Welcome to today's edition of stocks that are giving the glizzy to the market.

Today's top mentions include the #1 take-over by Apple that occurred over the last 30 minutes. Here they are:

&#x200B;

* AAPL: Apple became the #1 stock mentioned on WSB at exactly 11:20am. What happened? The share price went from +0.50% to -3% in a matter of minutes. It's actually amazing how fast WSB is to take note of any action in the market. The correlating AAPL chart is below so you can see the change of mentions on the first chart vs the stock price.
* CLOV: This stock seems to have taken the #1 squeeze name on WSB. My theory is that AMC and GME are old news and now CLOV, which is seemingly under-valued from reaching almost $30 just a couple months ago, has the potential to fly again.
* CCJ: A new name on the list and kind of unusual for WSB (uranium play??). WSB knows the power of uranium since a lot of members are probably buying uranium ore and storing it under their pillow versus just buying the stock.
* AMC: AMC nothing new here.
* TSLA: Elon tweets are keeping this stock alive as traders patiently wait for the next gamma squeeze.
