**Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation (Week 2) - $FB, $AMZN, $AAPL, $AMD, $MSFT, $PINS, and More**

&nbsp;

I fucking love earnings season. It’s an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What’s not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they’re one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

&nbsp;

This week, more so than others, is extra spicy, with all of $FAAMG (I kicked out Netflix for Microsoft after their disgusting showing last week) reporting alongside loads of other mega cap companies. There is a *stupid* amount of money to be made this week, for traders of all skill levels and styles.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades, I've enlisted the help of my buddy /u/laseryellow and [**compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qQTzoK79TEXtzRRmS3zILL-OkosPQ_CJqGrmMlsxp4o/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment, It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Enphase fucking MOVES! On average, the magnitude of any given move for it is 15%**!!! An awesome play here would be a long straddle, or reverse iron butterfly. You don’t know which way it’s gonna move, but you do know that wherever it does, it’s gonna fly.

- Although a relatively young company resulting in less data points, **Pinterest also moves with similar magnitude**. You could consider doing something similar on this ticker as well if you think these premiums are better.

- At the opposite end of the spectrum, we’ve got stocks that *dont* move whatsoever during earnings season. The IV on these tickers is unreasonably jacked up for no good reason, so we can look to *sell* options on them to amass a small fortune. **Sirius XM, General Dynamics, CME Group, etc, all don’t really move, but the options are priced as if they are going to anyways**. Use this to your advantage.

- **Over the past 25 earnings seasons, Shopify has gone up nearly 75% of the time**! If you want a “safe” gamble, selling ATM put credit spreads would net you some *insane* premiums. BP also follows a similar pattern, clocking in at a 68% beat-rate, allowing us to make this play one two separate days, ensuring we’re not over-leveraged.

- Lastly, **Microsoft also follows an extremely similar pattern, clocking it at a near 70% winrate**. It’s IV is considerably lower than the other two however, so one may want to use standard call / debit spreads in this case as they are pretty cheap relative to the stocks price and implied move.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 60 fuckin’ companies, theres plenty that I’ve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I’d love to see what you guys come up with.
