**Everyone has been waiting for this stock to move up.. could this be it?**    


After a nearly 2 month long downtrend, we are seeing an opportunity to breakout here.    
Great movement today from AAPL, a strong green candle with no top wick is just what we needed to see to regain hope.    


An entry will be made if we open tomorrow above the downtrend resistance line.     


**First Target: 128.50**   
**Second Target: 137.00**
