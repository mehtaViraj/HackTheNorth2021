**TLDR: AAPL is a low volatility play with a huge speculative upside, meaning tickets are cheap for the next rocket to Planet Tendies** 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀

Tomorrow, 23 February 2021 is the annual shareholders meeting. This is a good time to take a look at the "Apple of my eye", AAPL. Note, this is not an earnings report, but a shareholder meeting. More on that below.


**Upside:**

iPhone Sales - For the first time since 2016, Apple is #1 global smart phone sales. That means Apple has retaken their crown as the smartphone king. And this is all before 5G really takes over. I anticipate Apple iPhone sales to continue to perform well as 5G is rolled out globally. Strong smart phone sales continue to cement Apple as a very stable company, and situates them very well to continue expanding into other areas (hint hint Electric Vehicles).

Low volatility - considering the annual shareholder meeting is tomorrow, I am surprised to see that historic volatility is currently only 10%. This means options are relatively cheap. In my opinion this opens the door for a speculative play here, where we can see call options increase in price due to delta (AAPL stonk price increasing, which has historically performed very strongly) as well as IV (volatility) increase due to speculation. Apple thus far has been relatively quiet on their future plans, and I believe if they hint at any information tomorrow during their shareholder meeting or in the near term, we will be eating tendies 🚀 🚀 🚀

**Downside:**

Lawsuit with Epic Games - This is still pending, and currently Epic Games filed a lawsuit against Apple in the EU for "anti-trust" reasons related to mobile games and the iOS app store. I am not a lawyer and don't claim to understand what's going on, so I can't speculate on what this would do to the stonk price. It's something to keep in mind when considering your risk tolerance. Historically though it doesn't seem like anti-trust lawsuits have seemed to stop anyone, but I am open to other's thoughts here.


**Electric Vehicle (EV) Speculative Play:** 🚀 🚀 🚀

In my opinion, this is where the largest tendies will come from. There may be a huge speculative play here and I believe the combination of Apple being quiet on the topic while they work on the details (as per their normal playbook) as well as a general market sell off in response to recent market volatility (i.e. funds are selling off their AAPL to shift their gains to other areas to fight the market volatility), means we have a lower price AAPL stonk than I believe it should be. Basically, hedge funds are busy fighting in other areas of the market and can't allocate capital to speculate on Apple and are instead busy fighting the day to day fight in other stonks (GME?).

The Electric Vehicle (EV) play - there have been reports of Apple looking for an EV partner in 2021, and my opinion is I expect news on Apple's EV play over the next 3-6 months, if not during annual shareholder meeting tomorrow. 🚀 🚀 🚀

Of note, Foxconn which is Apples main chip producer, is releasing their own EV (independent of Apple) by EOY. In my view point, this means a major Apple partner who they have an extensive business relationship with already has the infrastructure and equipment in place to support an Apple EV play.

Most recently, Apple has been in early talks with car producers Kia as well as Hyundai. While nothing is official, this is evidence that Apple is exploring the EV market.

But keep in mind, Apple is a technology company so they can provide a car manufacturer partner with EV technology using their top computer science talent. Using existing skill sets and projects already in development, Apple can provide operating systems, Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning, self driving technology, LiDAR sensors, etc. to the EV space. In my opinion this makes Apple a speculative EV play.


**Financials:**

Sales grew a whopping 72% ($111.5B) in the previous quarter. They spent $5B last quarter on R&D alone. They reported a free cash flow of $73B in 2020 so they’re more than financially capable to pivot in the EV field. I point these numbers out as a reminder of how financially sound Apple is, which in my mind reduces the downside risk of any AAPL plays.

In 2020 the board of directors had a target goal of $265B in net sales and they hit $274B. The operating income target was $61B and they hit $66B. Clearly this board of directors knows how to get results and meet targets.

Furthermore, Free cash flow growth last quarter was 87% or $35B. That’s wild. Apple has the cash on hand to make any EV move they would like to


**What’s happening at the shareholder meeting:**

- Electing directors: reelecting to the Board of Directors: James Bell, Tim Cook, **Al Gore**, Andrea Jung, Art Levinson, Monica Lozano, Ron Sugar, and Sue Wagner;

- Independent accounting firm for auditing

- Advisory vote on executive compensation

- Adding a new shareholder nominated director position (increase from 1 to 2)

- Improve executive compensation program (director’s pay ratio is over 400 to 1 of the average employee)

- Questions and answers by Tim Cook. Will they speculate on the EV play? I believe that any hint of EV will send AAPL price skyrocketing 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀


**Price point:**

$175 base, $225 bull over the next months to EOY


**Positions:**

16 April $125/$130/$133.75 calls, 22 Jan $125 calls

**Bonus:**

Al Gore aka man bear pig is a director on the board for Apple.

The creators of the internet argue that Gore was “the first political leader to recognize the importance of the internet and to promote and support its development.” Clearly Al Gore saw the importance of the internet, and with EV being an environmentally green initiative, I believe he would see the importance of EV. If not developing their own electric vehicle, at the very least providing software/products for other EV players.
