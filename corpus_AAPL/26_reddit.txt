Today is the first time I feel bearish about AAPL. It's a money making machine but stock goes higher because of future earning / innovation potential and not because of how successful the company in the past. The headwinds include: epic trial, chip shortage leading to reduced iPad shipment and reduced future revenue, and possibly reduced iPhone 13 shipment due to no breaking changes. 

In addition to all these, already highest market cap in the market and inflation fear looming the tech sector. Since AAPL is such a big part of many indexes, the downward of indexes will affect AAPL a lot. Also, three top car division executives just left AAPL and it does not seem AAPL has made much progress in the car business which could be next big growth area for AAPL. 

Among a dozen of professional analysts, only 2 are bearish and last week New Streetâ€™s Pierre Ferragu gave a $90 price target EOY. No major banks have downgraded their outlook for AAPL and the consensus median is $160, average is $157.10, high is $185. 

What do you think about AAPL?
