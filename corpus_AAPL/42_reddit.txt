Hi, I am a 20 year old student who began studying Elliott wave principle recently in hope that it would improve my trading.

Is there anyone who could take a look at my analysis of AAPL stock? Now I do not know any of the indicators, this is purely based on my first impression on the chart employing the EW analysis I have been studying. 

Any opinion will be greatly appreciated, please help this boy out!

Please ignore the small writings, as they are basically me rambling to myself- 

 so in short, I think that the wiggly price action after wave 3 is wave 4 manifesting in a triangle, almost coming to an end, ready for a breakout to fib extension 1 of wave 1.   
I did also consider the sharp low after the wave 3 being the wave 4, but since it is too sharp in relation to the wave 2 and it took such a short time to do so, I figured it would be more reasonable to consider it wave A of a triangle, and so far the trend lines are supporting my theory. 

If it does breakout below C, then I would think that it might be the wave A of a correction, which could possibly retrace all the way back to somewhere between the extreme of wave 1 and wave 4, and that whole impulse being the wave 1 of a strong uptrend. 

This is my possible anticipation, it might sound absolutely stupid to some of you Elliotticians, as it has been only three days since I've started studying EW, and I don't know anything else about trading, this is the first point of my study. So please do give me generous criticism, how to improve! I tremendously appreciate your time, thanks for reading this long ass post.
