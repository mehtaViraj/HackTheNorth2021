TLDR: My autistic senses say Apple will beat earnings bigly on strong iPhone sales and higher av. selling price. AAPL calls for Jan 29 - March on any strikes above 130 will print

Positions: AAPL 132c 2/5

Over the last two weeks a few reports and FinNews articles have come out expecting strong iPhone sales for Q4 earnings. A strong quarter is expected with the first 5G iPhones and pent up consumer discretionary spending. Any retard could have predicted that but I believe that analyst estimates are low and more importantly is not priced in at $129-133. 

A few articles from shills and morons below

[Bezinga: IPHONE 12 SALES ARE 21% BETTER THAN THE IPHONE 11](https://www.gizchina.com/2020/12/29/iphone-12-sales-are-21-better-than-the-iphone-11/)

[Bloomberg: Supply Chain Sends Bullish Signal on 5g After Tepid Start](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-05/iphone-supply-chain-sends-bullish-signal-on-5g-after-tepid-start)

I did my own due diligence in November and December to figure out how many iPhones they were actually selling. Apple's suppliers posted Q4 [record earnings](https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/01/08/tsmc-sees-record-breaking-earnings-from-iphone-12-demand) signaling higher production levels than past cycles and analysts report Apple produced 79 million 5g units in Q4 and another 210 million units for FY2021.

 Analysts expect a[38% increase](https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/12/22/apples-iphone-12-shipments-set-for-38-annual-growth-in-q1-2021) in units shipped for Q1 2021 and a similar increase for Q4 sales. Additionally the average price of each iPhone sold is expected to be higher than past years (typically around $750.) The model lineup this year is more expensive on average and analysts speculate flagship models iPhone 12, 12 Pro and Max make up the majority of increased sales. 

Additionally sales in Chinese markets are expected to rise Apple market share past the 20% threshold they've been stuck at. 

Using availability data from the Apple website, I found that base iPhone 12 models in any color were sold out (unavailable for in-store pickup) in 80% of Apple stores by the end of December after holiday sales. This isn't an exact count but does suggest that inventories of iPhone 12 models are low even for the commonly purchased base storage models.

 Analyst estimates are almost surely correct and may be on the low side if inventories are as low as they look. Additionally the stock has priced in expected lower sales numbers due to a delayed launch date and production holdups. AAPL is still trading below ATH from September when reports came out regarding delayed launches. I believe that Q4 sales will beat significantly  and  since the launch was delayed, demand in Q1 will be greater and guidance for the quarter will be increased during the earnings call. 

**Positions**

\\We've been sitting at $128-132 for the last two weeks but I have a target price of $142 for post earnings through early March. AAPL is $2.22 trillion behemoth so significant price changes are difficult but the IV on options is low enough (42%) to be worthwhile.

 I have already committed the remainder of my options account to this play. I picked up $132c 2/5 on Wednesdays dip but any calls $130+ exp after earnings are a very viable and potentially lucrative play. 

If you buy puts fuck you.

On top of that I just have that autistic little feeling about this play. Felt that way about longing TVIX in February 2018 which was a 10 bagger and Palantir at $9. Being such an autist, I'm not so good with words but I like my numbers and they check out. And lets face it, you've yolo'ed on more retarded DD before.

Edit: Completely forgot the crucial part of a DD
