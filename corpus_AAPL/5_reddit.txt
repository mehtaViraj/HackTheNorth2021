Welcome to today's edition of stocks that are giving the glizzy to the market.

&#x200B;

1. CLOV: The number one most mentioned stock. I noticed over the weekend a lot of momentum started to build. Today the bias was confirmed.
2. AAPL: The blue chip stock that always gives back to investors. AAPL is indestructible with green day after green day.
3. TSLA: No description needed. In Elon we trust.
4. GME: GME has been lagging these short-squeeze stocks lately. Is it time this name takes off again? Earnings are coming up tomorrow after the close.
5. AMC: Still a top 5 squeeze stock and has been giving back to the ape community lately.

Here are the rest of the top tickers being mentioned on WSB and some of their current returns just before the close. A great $#(!ing day for WSB stock-pickers.
