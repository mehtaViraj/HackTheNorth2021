We have heard alot of rumors surounding Apple potentialy intergrating some of GSAT:s functionality in to the upcoming [iphone 13](https://fortune.com/2021/08/30/iphone-13-satellite-globalstar-stock-gsat/), that some sources claim is not going to happen. I tend to agree with the latter, but what I belive people are missing from the puzzle is the rumored new extreme version of the [Apple watch](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-26/apple-considers-launching-rugged-watch-for-extreme-sports), this is a product where GSAT intergration would make much more sense, and intergrating emergency beacon functionality to Extreme sporting watches has already been done by Breitling in their [Extreme watch](https://www.breitling.com/us-en/emergency/).

Alltough Apple watch might bring in as much revenue to GSAT as iphone 13 intregration would, im confindent that 37.5M every quarter in payment to GSAT is just the begining of the pontential cash flow from this product intergration.

Edit: If these mystery cashflows are going to be consistent 37.5M per qurater, that amounts to 150M every year. GSAT:s current revenue is 128M and the market value it at 4B$, if we assume that the market is pricing in around 17% Growth rate with a WACC of around 20% we get to the current valuation of 4B with today revenue. If we add in the extra 150M from this mystery customer and discount it with the same WACC and growth rate, we get to a valuation of 8.8B or a stock price of around 4.8. But if we say that this deal makes the market price in even more future growth, which i think it will, with a Growth of around 20% the valuation instead lands closer to 20B or 10$ per share.

Edit 2: Financial disclouser: I have several 5$ Jan 21 calls on this company, and thus this is not financial advice.

And also to make things clear this is not a fucking short squeeze play, there is barely any fucking SI on this company and everything does not have to be a short squeeze play. This is just a new cash flows play. Best of luck
