I JUST POSTED ABOUT THIS A COUPLE DAYS AGO. DEGENERATES UNITEðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€. AAPL were in acquisition and partnership talks in 2020, but they fell through. Bullish as hell on this for a couple reasons:

1. If AAPL wants to buy a company out or partner with them for their 1st ever EV project, then you know the company is LEGIT

2. Now AAPL is most likely going to sign an EV production contract w Hyundai (expected in March) and GOEV provides their platform to Hyundai. AAPL just decided to go through Hyundai to get the platform they want... which is GOEVs
