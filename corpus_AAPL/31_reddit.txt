My nephew told me about this reddit the other day and couldn't believe it. Read through a lot of it last night, you guys are fucking crazy but I love it. It's easy for any professional trader to say that you guys are idiots but I respect what you do, so no hate on my end. Trading is calculated gambling at the end of the day anyway. Compared to you guys, I'm basically a boring stock trader but damn good at it. AAPL is my baby.

I'm a swing trader on the 15min chart and 5min, just depends on the price action. I obviously don't win every trade but I shoot for large profits held over 1-3 days so losses don't matter. Willing to help any newbs sometimes and show you what my targets are on certain days when I see good bets.

Current:

For anyone that messaged me in chat, reddit clears out chats that are too far down on the list so if you don't hear from me in the next day or 2 then I've lost you! Send me a DM rather than a chat request to carry on our convo.
