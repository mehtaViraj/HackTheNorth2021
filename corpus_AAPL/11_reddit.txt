Welcome to today's edition of stocks that are giving the glizzy to the market.

AAPL: The apple event was a huge bust and the stock has tumbled one entire percent on the news that the next iphone is going to be 5% better than the current iPhone, as always. Mentions really began to spike at the start of the event.

FCEL: A new ticker on this list. FCEL is up 12%. I believe they are reporting earnings today after the bell, so watch the fuk out.

CLOV: 10 million apes waiting for the CLOV squeeze to happen. The stock is pretty much flat today and only down 0.5% instead of 10% for once.

TSLA & GME: These bad boys are always on the top 5 list. GME squeeze will happen any day now. Keep an eye out for posts that say "Why GME should be $10,000 per share"... those kinds of posts are usually filled with ~~genius~~ autistic advice
