When looking back at these companies, part of me feels like its just a no brainer to have dumped all my money into these companies because they paved the way of what the world is like now. 

Now that internet based companies have blown up to the extreme they can’t be the next big thing anymore because they already are the big thing. 

What do you guys think the next big thing is with the way the world is headed? What, ten years from now, am i gunna look back on and think “why the hell didnt I invest into that it was so obvious.” I’ve been pondering this for a bit now and the best i can come up with is Energy Cells. 

Thoughts? Ideas?
