The narrative between mainstream news and social media is very different.

[Top 10 Stocks on mainstream media \(past 4 weeks\) - source: stock-shark.com](https://preview.redd.it/0ah954s6q5c71.jpg?width=972&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9a2911373f9ee8a1974304e75b3203bc8b99600f)

The top companies mentioned on the news has been relatively unchanged, Pfizer & AstraZeneca has received continues news converge mainly to their vaccine roll out. Most of these stocks are significantly overvalued now.

As you can see Pfizer significantly peaked during COVID, followed by AstraZeneca, AZN seem to be declining in news coverage . Both stocks have a EV to sales ratio of about 6\~.

**Google Search Trends**

But lets take a look deeper on the top 10 stocks on google search instead. What are investors actually searching for?

[Top 10 stocks on Google search - source: stock-shark.com](https://preview.redd.it/0evq6uf2t5c71.jpg?width=940&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bf98aba36eeb996434171ccbbe6046a053b85537)

The top searches on google looks very different and gives us some interesting insights in Realtime interests.

[BLNK - Blink Charging Co](https://stock-shark.com/stocks/BLNK) has the highest search volume in the past 4 weeks. They specialize in electric vehicle charging equipment. Very overvalued at this point with a **Enterprise to Sales ratio of 282**!

That is 282x it's sales to enterprise value, which absolutely bananas.. It seems mainly driven by social media/ retail investor hype. Could this be a stock to short?

[Blink Charging has been declining ever since.](https://preview.redd.it/9isrfve7w5c71.jpg?width=724&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4dc2990aeea6a979a2b5f76a08d09da0ed622160)

So we can use google search trends to see what stocks are over hyped, or which stocks are feared.

For example lets look at [JD](https://stock-shark.com/stocks/JD), number 7 on the top google searches, and the only one that has a EV to sales ratio of less then 1. (JD is an internet market place in China)

JD is declining in price, but why? Well most of it is due to Chinese regulators clamping down on tech companies. So that has been allot of negative press lately. Retail investors seem to be existing their positions. But is this wise? 

Well JD has an enterprise value to sales ratio of  **0.92**, which is one of the few large tech companies in the market today 's that is actually **undervalued**. They have a avg sales growth of about 7%.

This is actually a really rare Jem.

Anyway, if you guys find this analysis useful, i would love to do more. Peace!
