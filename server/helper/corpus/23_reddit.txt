Yo degens,

Straight to the point, we're talking about $DOMA.

$DOMA went public in July this year via a SPAC. It was a shitty merger (*according to the market*) because the redemption rate was 85.5% which is super high (*as shown* [*here*](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1C65RwHVSLOUKkuJaf3RgkeDiuMmhrMMKYncfM7YrF0U/htmlview#gid=0)).

This left them with a tiny float of just \~5 Million for a company with a market cap of $2.5 Billion! On top of that, they have options which shouldn't even exist for a company that has such a low float (*this is literally a loophole which SEC will probably fix eventually*).

Now what makes $DOMA interesting is the fact that it's overly shorted. The short interest ratio is **6.6 days**. What that means is that it will take 6.6 days worth of volume for SHORT-ers to cover their position. If they try to do it within a single day, I can totally see the price hitting $25 because of the lack of liquidity in this stock and the amount of Open Interest in option markets. Either way, there's a good chance it can unfold into a gamma squeeze potentially.

With all that being said, the IV on the options is going to be crazy but it can only get crazier from here.

Also remember they mainly cover the position towards the last 5 minutes of market close. Reason being that there are no margin calls issued before that. If anything, that's when you should expect to see major buying volumes.

Yesterday it closed at a low price of $7 and it hit $9 during after hours trading with respectable volume of 20,000 shares (*in 1 minute time period*).

Now here's the icing. DOMA has  managed to get a price target of $14.00 from analysts and a price target of $11.00 from Citi Group as well just this morning, Friday Sep 17, from Oppenheimer as well! These analysts know the company more than any of us apes in here. This is another instance of GME like stock being pushed down by the hedgies.

With some buy volume, the price action would be crazy for all of us to witness.

Disclosure: I have $DOMA CALLS Strike 10, expiring October, 2021.
