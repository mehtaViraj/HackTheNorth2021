Also, according to an interview done by the CEO, Q4 transactions reached record volumes that he has ever seen. Paysafe currently has 100% of Canada's only betting market and 75% of US betting market. Its main revenue comes from NFL, EPL and IPL (US, UK, and INDIA Cricket League). All of which started its season this month. Its volume will triple in Q4 and MM is shorting to drive retail out in Q3, this stock will easily triple from its 2020 30% revenue increment not counting US market.

Looking at a larger basket of comps with a collective growth rate of \~12.5% (not far from Paysafe’s minimum 10.6% projection) here are valuations based on PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, bill, GPN, and Paysign among others:

Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples:

EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09

EV/Rev ratio : $83.91

EV/FCF ratio : $87.86

Average: $97.95

After eliminating outliers with highest multiples:

EV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75

EV/Rev ratio : $44.64

EV/FCF ratio : $44.18

Average :$46.52

Notes:

1. Unlike Paysafe, around half of these competitors report negative EBITDA growth and a third report negative EBITDA and negative free cash flow.
2. Used low end of Paysafe's projections and factored in debt and high-end of potential dilution.
3. As noted Paysafe’s 10.6% rev growth projection excludes planned inorganic M&A growth and projected 55% CAGR iGaming growth, which constitutes a third of their revenue.
4. The above comps were taken during a sector-wide pull-back and do not reflect recent fintech gains since Jamie Dimon’s "enormous competitive threats" comment.

This is not any financial advice, but I am just a nerd that all in on Paysafe at 8.2. Only when we unite, we become stronger and earn from short sellers. GME took 1 year to run from 3 to 300. Psfe has positive net income + cpypt wallet + igaming market. I am ULTRA LONG here so if you want to 10x your money here's your chance.

Btw, Grasso tweeted and hes still holding for his 45 pt too. Affirm has recently gap up 100%, and greensky acquired by GM at 4x rev with declining rev YOY. PAYSAFE has a 20% increment rev YOY if accounting for divested product. The shakeout continues but you have a greater upside now :).

Easily from my calculation, 10% shorts are trapped, and long holders are ultra long holders. Blackstone, CVC, blackrock, cannae, dan loeb and many more. Any momentum here will send this to 30 ish imo. Do your own DD. UNLIKE WISH SOFI OR ANY OTHER TICKERS PUMPERS POST HERE, PSFE reveneue increased 20% yoy, igaming up 50%, book net income positive for the first time, and exceed analyst expectations. ALIGHT another blackstone and cannae ticker, experienced the same event, went down to 8.2 and rose all the way up to 13 on 5% rev increment. PSFE has 20% :)

For comparison sake, IRNT has 6m rev down 20% YOY at 2b Market capt while PSFE has 1.55b rev up 20% YOY at 6b Market capt. 3x market capt at > 100x rev and upside YOY.
