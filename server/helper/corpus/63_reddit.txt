Sup gambling retards. It's my first post here on this. But who really cares. You retards only want that sweet DD right? So here I go.

Crocs (CROX) has been booming like crazy since the pandemic and the stock price has gone through the moon. But did you know that it still can go to Mars. Hold you horses. I know your dick is getting hard but bear with me.

Crocs is shoe company that consists of brands such as "Clogs", "Sandals", "Jibbitz charms", and "LiteRite". The vast majority of Crocs shoes features Croslite material, a proprietary technology that makes users feel comfortable in their shoes. And people, especially these poor Gen Z and millennials buy these products like there is no tomorrow.

Crocs has been partnering up with celebrities such as Justin Bieber and most of these collaboration products are sold out.

Andrew Rees joined Crocs as President in June 2014 and became CEO and joined the Board of Directors in June 2017. He is just the CEO I am looking for. This guy knows the company's operating and culture. He has more than 25 years of experience in the footwear and retail industry. Prior to Crocs, he served as Managing Director of L.E.K Consulting in Boston where he founded and led the firm's Retail and Consumer Products Practice for 13 years. While at L.E.K, Rees served as a consultant for Crocs from 2013 to 2014, supporting the development and execution of the company's strategic growth plan.
