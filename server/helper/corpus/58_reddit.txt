Not sure why no one has posted about Weber.  Their grills dont suck, they last forever, and are made in the usa.  They just ipo’d last month, wednesday is their first earnings call, and their options are stupid cheap. This has degenerate gambling written all over it so I just opened a lunch money position of calls this afternoon.  

$4b market cap with 18m shares outstanding, 6.49% SI with a 27% borrow fee.  I’m gonna go ahead and disagree with the bear case, and state the reasons why i like this play

-the current climate of stimmies and more people spending time at home are a good combo for this type of purchase.  Grills are in most demand in spring and summer so i would think this earnings has a better chance of solid numbers than fall / winter reportings.  

-Significant ftd’s for the most recent reporting (fails reported every single day, with days of over 1 million fails seems pretty high given an 18m float) makes me think theres some 🌈🐻’s afoot that could amplify an upward movement. 

-p/e ratios past & future being reported are kinda all over the place but i dont see anything that suggests this stock is grossly over valued.  Exerpt from an article i found

 “Weber generated $1.5b in 2020 revenue (its fiscal yr ended last september) and earned $88.4m.  These past six months saw revenue jump 62% year over year to $963 million with net income of $74m.  While I’ve yet to see earnings estimates, if the company could get to $2b revenue this year it would be trading at 2.75x revenue.  If Weber could manage $150 million in 2021 net income, it would be trading at 37x earnings”

-No one is talking about it, which makes me think this could be a sleeper pick.  Earnings should bring volume and volatility to a stock currently within a buck of its historical low, for a company with the biggest market share in the industry for several countries.  

-I own a weber charcoal grill, vertical smoker, and a 3 burner spirit gas grill and i fucking love them all.  Customer service is very good, parts arent cheap but you get what you pay for.  They are a household name because they’ve been making really good stuff for over 50 years.  

-Currently trading a couple bucks under most moving avg indicators.  Though the stock is a month old so take with salt.  Highs following the IPO were over 30% higher than the stock sits right now.  

Again, this is NOT a yolo for me, I have only a small position.  I just see it as a high floor gamble that could be fun.  Hoping these calls print so i can exercise a few and go long, i def like this company.  But we all know what can happen at earnings ESP when shorts are involved so this is NOT without risk, i am not a financial advisor and this is absolutely not financial advice.  These are my own terrible ideas and words. 

I hope that i am not wrong, and that any of you beautiful retards who might choose to jump on this trade are rewarded with copious tendies.
