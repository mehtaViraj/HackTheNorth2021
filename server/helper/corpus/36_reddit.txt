I mean think about it. Google has aspirations to take Amazon's lunch and dinner and eat it. What is the best way to do it?

Has to be shopify right? Why hasn't it already happened? Maybe shopify doesn't want to sell? But if that is the case, hostile t/o is in cards like what happened with ebay / paypal split? Ebay didn't want to split ebay and paypal so Carl Ican forced their hand

If i am Carl Ican, i will buy tons to shopify and force a sale to Google. That would be a quick and easy way to make a few billion. 

What do you guys think? Makes sense or am i retarded?
