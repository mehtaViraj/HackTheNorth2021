SOFI seems to have hit a bottom around $17.25 today... and with PIPE selling exhausted- is ready to move much higher. (and what little selling may occur from employees- is a drop in the ocean compared to retail buyers... considering SOFI has less than 1000 employees). 


Cramer just included SoFI as 1 of the post merger SPACs to buy now. SOFI has all buy ratings from analysts- with an initial $30 price target.  SoFI also has one of the highest short float % at around 45% (which meaning many Millions of shares have to he bought to cover those short positions). 


And with a market cap under $14B, SOFI is extremely undervalued (consider Robinhood going public later this summer around $40B.. likely to be $60B after 1st day of trading).  Buying SOFI anywhere near current prices- will definitely be a winner going forward.... and if SOFI gets several days of sustained volume... it is very likely to have a big run/squeeze combo in the immediate future. But its a definite big winner either way.  Not to mention a 2 for 1 deal... as Galileo will be worth just as much as SOFI- and an option to spin off in the Future (similar to EBay & Paypal)


**Summary of SOFI Becoming a Fintech Behemoth**

Fintech is becoming the next big disruptor- and Sofi is being positioned to be the real leader in this category (and currently- the dinosaur banks have market caps of 300B, $450B, etc). Not only is SOFI the only internet bank with the full slate of financial products...
they also have Galileo for the platform/
Software fintech play... just look at the top quality leadership team SOFI is attracting... Anthony Noto as CEO.. CFO came from Uber... person in charge of Galileo from Google,etc.


**Overview of Business **

SoFi acquisition of Golden Pacific will make it a
national bank, like JPMorgan Chase. This will
allow SOFI to take direct deposits & make
loans based on those deposits, rather than
acting as a re-seller.

Sofi also offers Credit Cards & recently
announced it deal to offer auto loans. Also,
theres SoFi brokerage, which competes with
Robinhood.

Then add to the mix, Galileo, a payments
processor (ie Stripe, Square ) it bought for
$1.2B. Galileo dominates the Banking-as-a-
Service (BaaS) ecosystem. Galileo offers
banking platform for over 90% of all digital
banks in North America. Over 70% of Top100
Fintechs globally are clients- including Chime
and Robinhood.
