I've seen a good bit of TA on $PLTR but not a lot of fundamentals. Some companies like Google have refused to do work for the government^(1) but others like $PLTR have chomped at the bit for the contracts. I think this is probably long term a good thing for the company (increased cash flow) but wondering what you all think? I also think Peter Thiel tends to moon-shot anything he gets near which is probably a plus.
