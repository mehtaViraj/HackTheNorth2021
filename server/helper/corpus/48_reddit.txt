I know GME AMC and CLOV are not the same and I am not here to bash either GME or AMC just pointing out some similarities between the three. I support GME both AMC and GME. Full disclosure I am not the first to point out these similarities but I have looked into them myself using the charts I pulled off of the SEC Website. AL Trades is where I first heard the information about a week ago in a youtube video and I just went and did some of my own digging to confirm the information he provided. 

Looking at the Charts you see peaks in FTDs in Both GME and AMC before the price run up. **FOR GME HAPPENED 3 TIMES and THE FTD PATTERN HAS AN ERIE CORRELATION THE SHARE PRICE IMO.** 

The Peak FTDs for GME were just over 3m and GMEs Float is 56m according to Google

3m FTDs / 56m Shares = just over 5% of the float 

The Peak FTDs for AMC were just over 27M and the float according to google is 511m

27m FTDs / 511m Shares = Just over 5% of the Float 

The Peak FTDs for CLOV were just over 19m and the Float according to Google is 133M

19m FTD’s / 133m Shares = **Just over 14%**!

Another thing I want to point out is that AMC before it big run up had a mini squeeze similar to what we saw from CLOV in June. 

AMC went from around $2 to $20 then back down to $6 

CLOV went from $6 to $28 and is now in the $8 range which it has been for a couple of weeks now. Is the Bottom in for CLOV? I don’t really know but I hope so. 

**Full disclosure I am a CLOV shareholder and very bullish on CLOV from all of My research I have done and that others have done.** 

**I am not a financial adviser and this is not financial advice. Just pointing out some things I see from the Charts.** 

**I hope that everybody does they’re own due diligence before investing and hope that everybody makes some money investing.** 

**If you don’t like this post, please provide some constructive feedback and specific reasons why.** 

**Last but not least LFG GME AMC AND CLOV.**
