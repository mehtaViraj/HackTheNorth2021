That's exactly how the hedge fund run media outlets were printing across the internet!!! you even see many bear commenters saying this across the reddit board to scare everyone. Here's an example of one of the fake media outlets saying ford dropped qnx [ford drops qnx](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/ford-sync-google-android-blackberry-qnx-infotainment/)

**The truth is.....NO, Ford did NOTTT drop blackberry QNX!!!!! they switched to QNX Hypervisor**

Each car has 100 Electrical Control Unit (ECU) performing all the smart functions from automatic brake to rear view camera to seat belt checks to acceleration to lane change etc....blah blah blah. **ONE  of hundred ECU runs the infotainment of the car**. The infotainment is the unit used to change your music radio etc...THE NON CRITICAL AND SAFETY FUNCTION OF THE CAR. SO IF INFOTAINMENT CRAPS OUT WHILE DRIVING NO ONE WILL GET HURT OR DIE. Ford essentially is dropping blackberry QNX to go with google android. BUT, remember car companies are consolidating ECU to reduce number of chips they need, so FORD instead is using Blackberry QNX Hypervisor on the chip and running android on top. The hypervisor runs the infotainment(fm/am radio etc) and the instrument cluster(speed gauge....critical stuff). 

Blackberry QNX Hypervisor ([here](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/software-solutions/embedded-software/qnx-hypervisor)) lets you run non-critical (google android) and critical (qnx for cluster) on the SAME CHIP!!! 

Essentially Ford is paying more to use Blackberry Hypervisor. They chose this route becuase they don't want to continue developing the infotainment portion in-house due to cost. they're out sourcing it to google...this is a non-critical function inside the car that no one care if it fails. For everything else inside the car QNX is used extensively because it's the only ASIL-D certified software.

Google and Blackberry are working together for this infotainment portion. If you read this article it specifically refers to Hypervisor. Basically android will be running on BB QNX Hypervisor!!! You can't run cars on android!!! Every piece of critical ECU inside the car including the modem that connect to the internet is running Blackberry QNX.

**Summary:** It's bunch of FUD that Ford dropped QNX. **In fact Ford has switched from Blackberry QNX to Blackberry QNX Hypervisor**. The BB hypervisor will run non-critical/non-safe android on top for the infotainment function. **So please stop this fake stuff about how ford dropped BB**. There are 400 Blackberry employees working at Ford design lab!!!!
