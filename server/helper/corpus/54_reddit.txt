I love Dutch Bros Inc, $BROS, and I love windmills. I went to Portland in 2016 for my sister's wedding and had some Dutch Bros cold brew. It was the best cold brew from a chain that I have had. The employees were the happiest employees that I have ever seen.

In the US, they have 422 stores currently and are valued at \~$1.5b. SBUX has \~15k stores and is valued at over $100b. BROS is currently window/drive-thru only. Less retail space needed. Faster service.

I think BROS will pass SBUX in under 10 years. It is very early for BROS. Scaling and maturing takes time, but BROS can pull it off.

*why* I think **BROS > SBUX**.

**SBUX** is depressing. Baristas do not want to work there. Their drinks are disgusting. People only go there because it is what is closest or available.

**BROS** is mostly west coast and some central. They will eventually cover the entire US. They have smaller overhead, a more excited staff, and more creative drinks. 

Who are their customers? Their brand has a retro Stranger Things vibe and their culture values kindness and friendliness. This attracts a "heart on their sleeve" Gen Z, and a more trendy Millennial audience. Google: Dutch Bros vs Starbucks and you'll find many surveys and comparisons from college audiences that prefer BROS over SBUX.

**SBUX** is a gross late 90s early 2000s corporation associated with suits that don't fit, music legends selling out (Google: Starbucks signs Paul McCartney), and the over commercialization of America.

**BROS** is the perfect homegrown powerhouse to take the crown from the scaly monster.

This is not financial advice.
