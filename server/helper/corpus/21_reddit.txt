$wish possible buyout check DD on Twitter @kevofwallstreet


let me start by saying this thread is merely SPECULATION. nothing  is concrete. 
 #1
- this all starts with the CFO resignation which really caught us ALL by surprise. why would the CFO accept a position elsewhere if WISH truly has so much potential?

#2- thats where this begins. now, if said company happened to be bought out.. some positions would be redundant. 
          - you do not need 2 CFOs.

#3

lets go through the list. 

we've seen 2 quite massive candles this week after hearing "HUGE $7.5 CALL VOLUME" etc. makes you think. 

 #4 .. zero PR since its Q2 ER disaster. average cost on WISH is currently $7.65 .. retail presence GREATLY decreased.  

while you have seen retail panic, multiple resignations, private equity has been soaking up these dips. 
"Hedge Funds now hold over 25% of the common"

to finish up on this first topic, lets keep in mind the resigned CFO still holds 836,992 shares.

now who do i think will acquire wish..
Google. yeah. Google.

Google recently partnered with $SHOP .. "this one shows little sign of working" .. so what is Google's next move?

lets keep it going. Google aims to help people shop for the products from "direct-to-consumer or the mom and pop shop down the street" this is where Wish Local comes into play. "Wish is free to download and use; they offer low prices because of a direct-to-consumer model"

call me delusional, but in my eyes.. the recent action screams buyout. from void CFO position, SILENT management, tute buying, call volume, along with Google's recent push to present itself as "a cheaper and less restrictive" $AMZN. let me know your thoughts.

oh, and lets not forget those recent GOOGLE hires.
