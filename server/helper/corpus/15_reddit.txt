**U.S. and Worldwide Data for April since release of Numbers**

* Bigger Companies at Top, Smaller at bottom.

&#x200B;

**Result:**

* HBO/AT&T is the only company that really shows a big uptick this April since  release of March numbers. Previous uptick on google trends along with box office hit resulted in big increase in subscribers, Q4 2020.
* Could be a big Q2 2021 for HBO, not definitive.

&#x200B;

**Disclaimer:**

* Not a perfect estimation of subscribers but graphs are good to see.
* Don't base investment decisions off my opinions or graphs.
* Streaming services do not make up the full businesses of $T, $CMCSA, $VIAC, or $DIS.
* There  is a chance google trends is greatly affected by marketing efforts and  not people/customers.
* HBO also has the potential for previous Direct TV subscribers to move to becoming online subscribers, which would not increase overall users but would increase google trends.

&#x200B;

**Google Trends "Search Term"/ "Television Network"**

* HBO gained the most subscribers in Q4 2020 with the release of Wonder Woman. Roughly 8 million net additions domestically for Nov-Dec alone. You can see this in the holiday uptick on the graph (above).
* Netflix also had a holiday uptick from viewers but it did not gain a lot of subscribers. No Box Office hit like Wonder Woman.
* Box Office hit + Uptick in google trends = subscribers (theory).
* HBO had no big upticks or box office hits in Q1 2020. A small uptick for Snyder cut, maybe but still not that noticeable, they added 2.7 Million net subscribers and still beat estimates.
* AT&T/HBO had 1 big uptick, and 1 medium one in Q2 2020 already (Kong and Mortal Kombat).
* HBO estimated 67-70 Million subscribers worldwide by the EOY while considering that they go international this June. If they got another 8 million domestically this April they would be at 70 Million today before the international push. They might not have.

**HBO vs Netflix, Past 90 Days:**

HBO closer in the month of April regardless of upticks than any previous month.

* HBO has previously beaten estimates by alot and it did not really affect share price. However it now will make a bigger difference in terms of ARPU then it did in the past.
* Graph/Link (below) by an author who a couple days earlier was negative towards HBO. Stating that it was not sticking. He rechecked his numbers.
* Warner Bro's/HBO is not the main part of AT&T's business. They are a big company with a lot of debt. This is just a look at the movies/streaming services this quarter.

**Paramount vs Peacock, WorldWide past 90 days:**

* Peacock went from 31 M subscribers Q4 2020 to 42 M in Q1 2020.
* Paramount+ really had its debut on March 4th, big uptick.
* This graph makes it seem like "paramount" could be close to "peacock" in terms of subscriptions. Nothing to note for April though, no second big uptick.
* This is not a perfect tool, just something to see. More info from HBO graph than this one.
* Both businesses have more than just streaming as major revenue sources

**Kong might make $1 Billion in profit this quarter alone, not counting HBO subscriber gain.**

Another point for movies this year is  online rentals for Godzilla vs Kong might have been close to box office  revenues due to covid-19. Only the U.S. gets it for free on HBO. International rollout for HBO set for this June.

In other countries you could rent Kong for 48 hours for $20-25.  More theaters were closed outside the U.S leading to higher likelihood of renting the movie.  It was $25 to see the Box Office hit of the spring. Not bad for you or your kids to see the epic monster mash.  Probably hadn't been to theaters or rented/paid for a movie in a while.

&#x200B;

* Only U.S. gets it for free on HBO + Theaters were more likely closed in other countries.
* Worldwide ticket sales are roughly $70 million U.S.  and $500 Million International.
* Kong made $500 million in ticket sales and may have made close to another $500 million renting online.
* That's only 25 million people @ $25.00.
* If 10 million people worldwide rented it that is $200 million + no splitting ticket sales with theaters + HBO subscribers.

&#x200B;

* Godzilla  movies generally net like $100 million in ticket sales in Japan alone and is generally one of the highest grossing films of the year for them. Mugen Train just made over $350 Million in ticket sales in Japan alone.
* Kong has yet to be released in Japan and has the potential for alot more money. It is being released late there on May 14th.
* Been delayed again since due to covid-19, maybe they'll just make everyone rent it... or try a Japan HBO rollout.
* Potentially 1/2 - 1 billion dollars of profit from one movie is nothing to sneeze at for a single quarter (150 Million budget).
* No real idea of how many people rented it.

I  do however know people who rented Mortal Kombat and bought the game as well this  quarter (another AT&T). Don't know anyone who rented Kong but I have not asked so...

Warner Bro's/HBO is not the main part of AT&T's business. They are a big company with a lot of debt. This is just a look at the movies/streaming services this quarter.
