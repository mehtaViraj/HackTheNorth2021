Lurker turned poster with this one, guys. I'm a relatively new retail investor with a track record of more snakes than ladders. I'm looking for guidance that'll allow me to better identify lucrative trading opportunities & keep up to date with the most relevant & fruitful news.

At the moment I'm pretty much just pissing in the dark and at this point both legs are drenched. 

What apps are y'all using to keep up to date, receive alerts & trade. I'm based in the UK and currently have an incredibly shitty manual system of flicking between Freetrade, Investing.com & straight up just googling "[insert failing ticker here] news" to get my info. I know, I'm pathetic but you read the title so you already know that.

I'm at my wit's end, I'm stagnating and I feel like the rate at which I'm learning & developing strategies is far too slow. If one maybe a few of you folks could point me in the right direction I'd be so much better off. 

What am I missing here? Is it gumption? Is it intelligence? Or is it simply one or two industry standard tips&tricks that I've negated to discover over the last year or so.

Thanks in advance
