 **TL:DR: GF and I let our 1.5 and 7 YO children pick stocks and invest $10 a week for them. Pretty fun so far.**

So my girlfriend and I saw this post, which prompted us to teach our children about investing:

We decided to invest $10 a week for both kids, but let them pick the stocks. The goal to teach them about investing. It will also be interesting to see what they pick over time and how they do. It's only \~$1k per year, educational, fun, and saving for their future. Accounts are still in our names, cash accounts only, no options, so risk is minimal and the investments are small enough that we're ok if they lose it haha.

One child is 7, so far he picked Moderna because of the high returns it's had this year.

The other is 1.5, so she rolls a few dice to pick the page and # on the list for that stock. Somehow she ALSO picked Moderna lol.

Stock list they pick from: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KPrg2JhYUOSpkg6gsXURqqAGDuPenpwM/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=113534596477159381995&rtpof=true&sd=true](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KPrg2JhYUOSpkg6gsXURqqAGDuPenpwM/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=113534596477159381995&rtpof=true&sd=true)

Not the best, but it's a start. They're young so extra information really won't be helpful to them. I plan to make it into an automated excel file for updating prices and more information eventually.
