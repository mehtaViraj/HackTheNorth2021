# Dear Apes,

# I've got more news... and frankly, it is beyond my wildest dreams.

We  had **TESLA** loving AMD, adopting their APUs & GPUs in the MODELS X  and S, and an optional for other vehicles. This pushes AMD to MARS... as  autonomous driving is a perfect for gaming.

We  had **Google** signing a contract to adopt Milan Epyc Datacenter CPUs for virtual machine offerings... SMOKING intel. HUGE DATACENTER WIN, as the TCO is dropped dramatically.

We had the 6900XTX Liquid Cooled breaking **World Records** (previously held by the 6900XT).

We have **Valve** releasing a new handheld with AMD by the holiday season 2021.

We have **Fidelity FX Super Resolution** with AMAZING FPS boosts in Ultra Quality and Quality modes (launching **tomorrow**).

We  have the AMD Advantage Program for LAPTOPS allowing for a 5900HX (TOP  mobile CPU) to be paired with a RX 6800M, an VALUE HIGH-END mobile GPU.  Giving Mobile 3080 like performance at $1650, with high refresh monitor  (300Hz on 1080p to 140Hz on 1440p).

But now... it is **Samsung**'s latest info.

We knew AMD was coming in the Galaxy S22.... but it gets BETTER!!!

The  performance of RDNA2 in mobile is **beating expectations**... and SAMSUNG  is signing a future deal with AMD... as they are **SUPER PLEASED** with  AMD's performance. Samsung will effectively ABANDON their GPU plans and  work with AMD going forward.

But that IS NOT ALL.... **GOOGLE** also wants AMD in their Mobiles.

Google, the **Android** software developer... wants AMD. This is NUTS.
