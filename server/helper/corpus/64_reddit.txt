Its easy to understand why we are in an "austrian crack up boom."

Low rates equals high equities. period.

The fed, (sir powell) has literally kept the money printer rolling. But what happens when the Treasury General Account runs out of out money?

The breadth of the market bull run has literally become the smallest all year long.

You now have people like Macrovoices Eric Townsend bringing on guests to discuss long volatility. they did this in Q1 of 2020. Which i actually played and did very well.

That said I've seen all the arguments for why the market is going to crash.  Yet it seems we need some sort of trigger to get out of an algo range and actually cause a pull back. Could it be:

1. debt ceiling not raised by US gov?
2. geopolitical wars
3. hedge funds just ganging up on the apes?
4. Gridlock in Washington?
5. Election proven to have had fraud?
6. Biden elections new fed chair focused on equality and turns the printer off instantly.

We know the members of the fed played volatility right before the market crash too.

Even the perma bull Cramer is now being hailed as a bear on twitter. (Cramer i can't stand watching you on squawk box, please retire... david faber is the real man anyway.. we all know this. Thoroughly enjoy watching him shut your toxic baby boomer rants down....)

Buffett indicator at all time high.

What if the austrian crack up boom actually comes to an end this year? as many analysts are now calling for a pull back by year end. Statistically it happens second half of september.

Would any of the triggers above actually cause a crash? It sure feels like 2000.

Why would WSB apes fight this? With volatility gone, epic runs and short squeezes have faded, at least in brevity.

Recently, i've been searching google trends for "market crash," "stock market crash," but today when i was randomly googling something else... an autocorrect came up for "economic collapse." So i went to google trends to see who all is searching for economic collapse. BOOM ALL TIME HIGH SEARCHES.

Volatility is good for apes like us. When it easier to make money on the way down, why aren't we all prepping to play this? (maybe we are look at volumes on UVXY over the last 45 days)

Food for thought, I'm just a retard and wondering what you guys/girls/apes think...
