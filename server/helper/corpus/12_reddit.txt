[Here's the article describing this potential deal](https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/vivo-flagship-smartphone-with-exynos-chip-amd-gpu-might-launch-soon/)

So what do we have here? The nÂ°5 on the smartphones market is also choosing AMD's technologies for its next smartphones! Just to remind you, this is a well known company in Asia, that keeps growing and has 8% of the market today. 

This is just another sign that AMD obtains more and more contracts on this new market (smartphones and potentially very small laptops).

Have fun and take care guys!
