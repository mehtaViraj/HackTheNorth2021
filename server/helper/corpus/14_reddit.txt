**AND** the company recently is rumored to be for [sale](https://pulsenews.co.kr/view.php?year=2021&amp;amp;amp;no=205435)🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

**AND** MX has $600 million of NOL carry forwards for next decade which historically cut its taxes substantially 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 Great for an acquirer

**About**

1. MX is a semiconductor company that makes **Display Driver Integrated Circuits** (DDIC). "DDIC chips are a core device for switching and displaying control functions needed by displays".
2. Magnachip is the #1 independent global OLED DDIC manufacturer (33% market share) in the world and provides solutions for phones, TV's, automobile screens (regular + EV), VR, and more. They supply to companies like Samsung or LG who controls 95% of the OLED display market. - [source](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/MAGNACHIP-SEMICONDUCTOR-C-6361073/news/MagnaChip-Semiconductor-Ranked-No-1-in-the-Global-OLED-Smartphone-DDIC-Non-Captive-Market-30995864/)

[Growing Revenue in OLED](https://preview.redd.it/f87ybxne5pm61.png?width=422&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4e0a6cfd4dc2cc8a3c1342b6f0d701db82d21d8)

**Currently MX stock is at $23 a share with $6 net cash on balance sheet (that's right, 1/4 of market cap is in cash). MX also owns a 8" or 200 mm (read 200 millimeter diameter) wafer manufacturing plant that produces 30k wafers per month, soon to be in the 45-50k wpm range that could be worth more than $250mm.**

A wafer is like a round super thin pancake - and Semiconductor chips (square) are grown on it and then off the circular wafer. The larger the wafer the more efficient - but right now most Semiconductor technologies use 200 millimeter (8 inch or 8”) or 300 millimeter (12”) diameters.

What MX owns is one of the hottest assets as there is a global shortage of 200mm manufacturing space.

* " The demand has been supercharged by a combination of the COVID-19-driven boom in computer gear and unexpected strength in auto sales that resulted in shortages. "
* “A real capacity increase would take nine to 12 months, minimum.”
* Used equipment prices have gone up by as much as 20% over the past six months, while the number of refurbished 200mm tools fell to 1,000, down from between 7,000 to 8,000 a decade ago.
* “You just can’t go out on the open market and buy a used 200-millimeter tool - they’re just not readily available"
* Demand for old tools is so robust that buyers are looking at every kind of factory.

**Enter MX with its Fab 3 8". Comparable transactions are listed below** **and values MX's foundry at possibly $250mm.**

The business of producing OLED devices and power integrated circuits also generates $60-65mm of EVITDA in 2021 given the sharp growth profile.

For Sale: " A source from the investment banking industry said many foreign firms – mostly U.S. and Chinese capital - have already expressed their interest and set up meetings with local securities and accounting firms to ready due diligence "

At an EV/EBITDA multiple of 15x would imply an equity value of $1.5 billion, up from its current market cap of \~1000mm. There is also downside protection from its $280mm in cash and \&amp;amp;gt;$250mm in foundry assets that don't appear on its PP\&amp;amp;amp;E given heavily depreciated. (and before any business earnings).

**If you’ve read this far, here is a juicy fact:** competitor Synaptics SYNA said in their Feb earnings call that they see incredible opportunity in OLED DDIC, MX’s bread and butter, and have a “tactical opportunity” this year. This was a month before MX sales rumors came out. With the $600mm of NOL carry forwards MX looks even more appealing for an acquirer.

SYNA CEO February: "**Given the supply crunch, we've seen an opening, an opportunity for us for OLED DDICs...The current supply base in OLED DDICs has been compressed**..\[On\]...the second half of the year, as I mentioned, we do see a frontier opening up on OLED DDICs. Today, we have no revenue there. We don't think that -- in a backward look, we thought the margins were going to be challenged there, but **the dynamics have changed very significantly in that market, and we think that there's going to be a tactical opportunity.**"

This is some deep deep value u/deepfuckingvalue

**TLDR: MX has 50%-100% upside at current prices and very high margin of safety. BUY SHARES AND SEP OTM CALLS**🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
