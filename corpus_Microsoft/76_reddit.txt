I’m sure everyone has heard about the microsoft news. They did not get the bid for tik tok. Oracle won it. Is this good or bad for microsoft? I’ve heard many different opinions on this. 

1. Clearly it could go down and they could tank 
or 
2. They might be green tomorrow because the deal wouldn’t have benefited microsoft anyways rather causing them more of a headache.  

There is also news about Microsoft’s new ultimate game pass being released Tuesday. 
At this point I thought the whole tik tok news was old news but it seems people are freaking out and thinking it will tank. 

I have two 220c 10/16. I’m very worried at this point this news will affect them negatively. 

edit: should I sell or hold onto them?

What are people opinions on this ?
