Listen up slow pokes I’m using emojis so you understand:

🐂 + 💵 + 🚀 = 💰💰💰

Disclaimer: this is my first post but I take losses every week so Ik what I’m doing. 

For the more competent folks here, Amazon is the most anticipated earnings coming up. This stock has been a sleeper since it ran up crazy this summer. They don’t want you to pay attention to it. But there’s a lot of reasons to give it a yolo option play for big tendies.

DD: 
- Amazon makes money, lot of money.
- Holiday numbers
- waiting for technical breakout above $3500 
- potential split for Bezos ego to reclaim #1 wealthiest 
- where’s the downside fr unless the market tanks
 
If there’s any received positive news and we have a decent earnings season amzn will move 10% to break $3500. 

If a split is announced I’m expecting a 30% run at least, could skyrocket to 50%+ so be aware. Apple ran up 30% and Tesla ran up 70%.

Some affirmation for this play is watching other earnings reactions on good news, Bezos does not disappoint. 

Imma be honest this is more of a yolo but just hear me out. 

The main play here: 
- DEBIT SPREADS WITH TIME 
 
I’m going for doubles, ones much closer to the money around February then looking at the $4000’s+. 

My position:
Double Debit Spread for Feb 19
- $3190/$3200 
- $4000/$4300
Cost: $900

The main goal is that total cost is less than the closer atm spread. This security allows for the spread to be paid for with a measly 1% move but if there’s a split max return:

$30,000!!! For $9.00

Some considerations for the week are the market sentiment and Biden economic plan. 

For the og wsb purist types just buy the $4000’s for $10.00 for so

POSITION UPDATES: 

- Earnings are February 4th, March may provide less iv crush but will be harder to exit
- if you don’t know what a spread is just buy March $5000c for $400 or so could pay (this is a yolo and if no split abort) 
-average Amazon Bull run is 26% over 18 days I’m still holding Feb 19ths but may pick up a March $4500c closer to earnings 

May the force be with you
