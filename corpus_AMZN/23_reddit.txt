Amazon has just recently broke out of a near year-long consolidation. And although WMT is a brick-and-mortar retailer, it has traded pretty closely to AMZN over the last year.

Walmart plus is Walmart's effort to combat Amzn's growing dominance with their own delivery service but they have failed to market it properly and have seen subscriber numbers remain stagnant. 

There was some unusual options activity on the 7-23 145 C and with the correlation in price with AMZN, I think this is a decent gamble with WMT's options being so cheap.
