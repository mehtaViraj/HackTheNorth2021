I will start off by saying this is not financial advice and I don't give a fuck what happens to my money.

So we're all aware Jeff Bezos is heading to space on July 20th.

My plan is to buy the July 23rd expiry FD puts on July 19th. 

In the event that the Bezos bros go boom I'm gonna say AMZN will drop. 

I know this is dark but there is no way in hell this type of thing is "priced in"

TL:DR
Casino Longshot betting on Jeff Bezos' death

TL:CR

**UPDATE: 
Looks like Richard Branson is rushing to beat Bezos into space over the July 4th weekend. Some things should not be rushed, space flight is one of those things. 

And for that reason I will also be buying FD puts on SPCE
