I'm sitting here thinking, AMZN voiced its support of legalization. Because they did that, now AAPL has to do it. AAPL maintains the image that it's all about correcting social injustices. If that's true, they won't be able to sit back and not say anything now that AMZN spoke up. If AAPL does, all of the other tech companies will follow suit, or they'll be seen as the company that didn't speak up. This will become a corporate movement. Time to buy pot stonks... and get on Twitter to tell Apple they need to speak up as well.
