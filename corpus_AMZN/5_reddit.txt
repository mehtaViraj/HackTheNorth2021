**Why I bought $AMZN Calls for the Space Flight Tomorrow**

&nbsp;

Pretty no brainer trade tbh, only two scenarios can occur, both of which benefit Amazon.

&nbsp;

**Scenario 1 : Successful Space Flight**

This is the most likely outcome. The flight is good, and $AMZN rallies cause people are stupid as hell and don't realize that Bezos has nothing to do with Amazon anymore. Also the market has been red for 3 days straight and JPow wont allow that to happen so tomorrow will be green regardless. 

&nbsp;

**Scenario 2 : The Rocket Ships Blows Up In a Big Fiery Inferno Ball of Death**

This scenario may initially come across as bearish, but is actually the complete opposite. With Bezos dying, 30% of Amazon's entire float would vanish into thin air since he controls most shares. A dead guy cant sell his shares, so we could technically treat this event as a giant 1 Trillion dollar $AMZN stock buyback, which would happen instantly. Bezos dying in a rocket explosion would wipe out a large chunk of Amazons outstanding shares. Insanely bullish.
