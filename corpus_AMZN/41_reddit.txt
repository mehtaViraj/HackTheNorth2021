Had a near $2,000 bull run from March 2020 at a price of $1,600 to $3,550 in September. Huge symmetrical triangle on the weekly chart signaling another move of the same kind.

If we can get a similar move, that'd put Amazon over $5,000 by around August. I'm INSANELY bullish on AMZN. I'm currently swinging options expiring in 2 weeks, but I'd like to sell to buy an expiration much further out. Bought yesterday on the dip to $3,140. In addition, I'm hearing rumors of a potential stock split in the coming months. Literally ALL rumors tho so I'm not counting on it, but imagine the impact it'd have. As we've seen with Apple and Tesla, it will make Amazon go crazy

EDIT: Just to be clear, I'm not buying $5,000 calls and I don't imagine that price will come any time real soon... lol

But I do think 5K by end of the year
