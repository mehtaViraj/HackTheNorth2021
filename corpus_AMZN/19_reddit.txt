Hello All,

After my SOFI TA yesterday I had a request for a TA of these tickers and their potential price movement in the near future. Specifically, a visualization and breakdown of stocks that seem to "keep running."

See [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofh1ha/sofi\_soft\_technical\_analysis/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofh1ha/sofi_soft_technical_analysis/) for my SOFI technical analysis.

I am applying my strategy as a day trader to see what our long term resistance and support levels are. I'm simply a day trader of three years that has consistently used standard deviations, RVI, and volume on a 6month and 1year time frame to determine my buy/sell areas on stocks, no matter whether I am swing trading or trading intraday. My current trading accuracy is 81%.

\-Easy Breakdown of Statistical Standard deviations - 68% of a stock's price range is within 1 statistical standard deviation of it's average/regression trend (2 blue lines), 95% within two deviations (first upper and lower purple lines), and 99.7% within 3 deviations (upper and lower purple lines), known in stats as the 68-95-99.7 rule. These deviations also function, generally, as true support and resistance levels, with deviations, once crossed, becoming either the new resistance or new support level.

\-ZTS - Moving on news and hype since 3/8/2020. Here is the One Year and 6 Month Deviation Chart - [https://imgur.com/EBtv6RI](https://imgur.com/EBtv6RI)

ZTS has currently broken through all deviation resistance levels over the past 4-5 months however it is now at over +2 Deviations on both the One Year and 6 Month chart which indicates it is entering extremely overbought territory. Both + 2 Deviation Support Levels are $195. Should it crack through that soon, we should see prices back down to the +1 Deviation Support Level or $185. Now is not a good time to enter. The Stock has entered its selling phase and can easily crash a full deviation price swing in one day. Should it manage to continue upward, we could see prices around $205 (+3 Deviations) although this is unlikely.

FB has pretty much made it's long-term move for now. It was not able to break +1 Deviation Resistance around 355-358 on the 6 Month Chart. And its +1 Deviation Support on the 1 Year chart is $350, which it broke through pre-market. It is entering the selling phase and we should see prices back around the $321-328 Area, its long-term regression trend, before any deviation support helps to bounce it.

On Amazon's One year chart, it has tended to trend between +3 deviations, crash to -2 Deviations, then bounce, with most of the action happening between +1/-1 Deviations following the typical sine-wave like cyclical price pattern seen in many stocks. In the immediate future, it is, like FB, statistically overbought, hovering above +2 deviation support levels of $3500 and $3600 which it is likely to break soon and trend back to it's regression price of 3300-3350. Not the time to buy.

\-NVDA - One Year and 6 Month Deviation Chart - [https://imgur.com/HYsy5ne](https://imgur.com/HYsy5ne)

&#x200B;

It seems NVDA has finally completed its run up to +2 Deviation resistance on both charts, as you can see it bouncing off the 1st purple line this week. This indicates a bearish move to the downside after being extremely overbought the last 3 months. Our downside buy area would be between $665-678 and the immediate deviation support at +1 on both charts is $748-756 where it will likely try to hold trend before snapping down to it's regression trend line.

Hope these images help you all visualize price trends of these stocks. Good luck trading today!
