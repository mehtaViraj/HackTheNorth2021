If true this would be huge. [https://twitter.com/CGasparino/status/1386734121607745544](https://twitter.com/CGasparino/status/1386734121607745544)

Technically it looks like a 5-star set up on a chart heading into their earnings day this Thursday. Been in a channel for 8 months. Sitting at ATH's right now waiting for a reason to break out. A big earnings beat sends it higher or a split sends it higher. 

If there's a 6 to 1 or more split I bet we see +10% Friday even on average earnings. If we get an earnings beat plus a split then we're talking a once in a lifetime move for a biz their size - maybe 50% gains in the 1-2 months. Last time it consolidated this long it doubled in a leg up in 2-3 months. If they don't have numbers that get them there they will likely play the Split card. They know they need a breakout after the last 8 months and with a new CEO. Their last earnings was actually amazing but the stock didn't go because of the Bezos news. A big reason its stalled is the fact that it's 4k freaking dollars. A split means retail can jump in on shares & call options.

I follow lots of hedge fund guys on Twitter and they're all sharing the same article of this hedge fund guy Bill Miller saying AMZN will double in Barron's and they're all just waiting for a reason to send it higher.

If there's an earnings beat then over the next few weeks analyst after analyst will trip over each other upgrading their PT's which'll also send it higher. Analysts don't downgrade AMZN. They either keep their previous ratings or they upgrade. [https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amzn/forecast](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amzn/forecast)

If we get any kind of good news Thursday I think we have $4k upside in the next month at least.

I've done a lot of time doing DD on this and I think it's a rate 5-star situation so I wanted to bring it to the fam. 🦍 Would suck if I got rich/poor without you.

I think calls are the move since we're either in for sideways or 🚀🌕. 

I'm thinking **June 4 @ $4,000 strike** for price / expiry. 

Going to war tomorrow. Would love to have fam beside me. What say you?

UPDATE --
i just looked at the last 45 earnings for amazon, and compared price day of to 5 weeks later.

16% of the time, amzn's stock price increased >15%. 84% of the time amzn's stock did not increase by >15%. Among the times that amzn saw a 15%+ increase over the following 5 weeks post earnings, the average gains was 19%.

Something to keep in mind if you wanna buy a call option. Historically we've seen big gains 16% of the time following earnings for AMZN.
