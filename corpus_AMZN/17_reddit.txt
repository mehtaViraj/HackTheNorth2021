Technically it looks like a 5-star set up on a chart heading into their earnings today. Been in a channel for 8 months. Sitting at ATH's right now waiting for a reason to break out. A big earnings beat sends it higher or a split sends it higher. I bought calls before the split rumor so that would just icing on the cake.

Anyone who thinks mega cap companies can't break out look at FB, up 7% today.

I follow lots of hedge fund guys on Twitter and they're all sharing the same article of this hedge fund guy Bill Miller saying AMZN will double in Barron's and they're all just waiting for a reason to send it higher.

If there's an earnings beat then over the next few weeks analyst after analyst will trip over each other upgrading their PT's which'll also send it higher. Analysts don't downgrade AMZN. They either keep their previous ratings or they upgrade. [https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amzn/forecast](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amzn/forecast)

If we get any kind of good news Thursday AMZN will have $4k+ upside in the next month. $5k upside in the next 2 months.

I've done a lot of time doing DD on this and I think it's a rate 5-star situation so I wanted to bring it to the fam. ü¶ç Haven't pitched an idea here before cuz this is the first really 5 star risk/reward bet I've found.

I think calls are the move since we're either in for sideways or üöÄüåï.

As for the Split rumor, if it's true it would be huge. [https://twitter.com/CGasparino/status/1386734121607745544](https://twitter.com/CGasparino/status/1386734121607745544)

If there's a 6 to 1 or more split I bet we see +10% tomorrow even on average earnings. If we get an earnings beat plus a split then we're talking a once in a lifetime move for a biz their size - maybe 50% gains in the 1-2 months. **Last time it consolidated this long the leg up was +100% and took 2-3 months**. If they don't have numbers that get them there they will likely play the Split card. They know they need a breakout after the last 8 months and with a new CEO. Their last earnings was actually amazing but the stock didn't go because of the Bezos news. A big reason its stalled is the fact that it's 4k freaking dollars. A split means retail can jump in on shares & call options.

A split isn't needed at all though for a break out. **Keep in mind the split rumor isn't priced in. It popped 0.8% when the rumor broke and then settled back down later the same day.**

The last thing that needed to fall into place was yield expectations for the next month and Powell's meeting yesterday should help in that regard.

I'm thinking **June 4 @ $4,000 strike** for price / expiry.

**Going to war in t minus 30 minutes.** Would love to have fam beside me. What say you?

*Obviously not advice I just really like the stock.*
