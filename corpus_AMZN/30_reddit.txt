Amazon will not acquire RAD.

&nbsp;

Too much has to happen for Rite Aids to become an "Amazon store"; You know [the look](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/23/business/22AMAZONGO-1/22AMAZONGO-1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600-v2.jpg). Even Amazon's internal healthcare locations have the look. Just check out [the inside of your local Rite Aid](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Aisles_and_goods_in_the_Rose_Hill_Rite_Aid.jpg/800px-Aisles_and_goods_in_the_Rose_Hill_Rite_Aid.jpg) and tell me its the same.

&nbsp;

The more intriguing options are 1) having no physically stores, or 2) use Whole Foods locations. Way back when Amazon first acquired Whole Foods, CVS, Walgreens, even drug wholesalers took major hits. Amazon already has 2/3 of what Rite Aid would offer: locations to act as distribution, if they were to go that route. But they will most likely continue offering pharmacy drugs through their existing channels: PillPack LLC and Amazon Pharmacy. 

&nbsp;

Amazon acquired PillPack for $753 million 2 years ago and has been working within Amazon Pharmacy on the home delivery for medication. Very little is said about this part in their investor reports, I was only able to find a few bullet points in the last couple years, but this looks extremely clear what Amazon is trying to do. They have Whole Foods for the brand and ability to deliver high end/organic groceries and Amazon Fresh for the normal things you'd find at a Walmart. Its always been about home delivery and only about how brick and mortar assists with that. A physical store acquisition "quickly" establishes a physical presence, but I don't see the need for one to move drugs. Or how that bolsters they're ability to deliver to homes. They have the facilities and logistics worked out for hundreds of grocery delivery warehouses and seems much more simple to tac on drugs there. 

&nbsp;

Between the [Q4](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2021/Amazon.com-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-Results/default.aspx) and [Q1](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2021/Amazon.com-Announces-First-Quarter-Results/default.aspx) reports they added another 10,000 to total 60,000 local pharmacies that offer discounts to prime users when paying without insurance. Why aggressively explore this if you were thinking of opening thousands of your own stores? Seems curious to me. 

&nbsp;

People here seem to be quick to write off PillPack as a failure with no justification. Summarizing a [CNBC article](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/10/why-amazon-bought-pillpack-for-753-million-and-what-happens-next.html) written around the acquisition:  More than 60% of American's have chronic illness and 40% have two. The average PillPack user in 2018 generated ***$5,000 in revenue***. The business was on track to generate $299 million in annual revenue [in 2018], with plans to more than double in 2019 to $635 million before reaching $1.2 billion in 2020. And medicine spending is expected to increase 3-6% through 2025. The long term outlook on PillPack is bright and Rite Aid just isn't the right choice for Amazon. I'll be honestly surprised if they ever actually announce they're buying them considering how long theres been rumors. 

&nbsp;

Also I don't think they would be eager to shell out more money after the MGM $8.5 billion buyout in May. They usual go about a year between >$1B purchases.  

#Telehealth trends due to COVID:
My thinking here is to look at the usage of online services in medicine due to COVID. It's my assumption that effects from COVID in many aspects are here to stay. Remote work is a good example and I see no reason why routine medical care, and even more routinized pharmacies couldn't be done online. I found [this gem from the CDC looking at Jan-Mar 2020 trends in telehealth](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6943a3.htm). Here's a [chart comparing 2019 to 2020](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/figures/mm6943a3-F1.gif) and this quote summarizes the major part:
>During the early pandemic period in 2020, the percentage of telehealth visits for persons aged 18â€“49 years increased slightly, from 68% during the first week of January 2020 to 73% during the last week of March .

A 5% increase in telehealth visits that happened almost entirely in March, a time when COVID wasn't seen as a problem in the US so we can assume it is substantially higher now. Cathie's TDOC pick isn't wrong, I can do a dive into them later if requested. But I think this points to online medicine continuing to become mainstream and the perfect environment for Amazon to fit in by delivering prescribed medication. People are becoming more time greedy (no commuting with remote work, food delivery/pick up) and don't want to waste the time of going into a store and wait in line.

#LinkedIn:
I sorted by people working for PillPack LLC or Amazon Pharmacy and got back 904 people currently working there, I'll say 950 for margin. Amazon's corporate job portal shows [99 full time openings](https://jobs-us-west.amazon.com/en/teams/pillpack). Thats a 10.5% increase of their workforce. They are looking to expand PillPack/Amazon Pharmacy. 

#TA:
Little TA an AMZN bc why not? Bounced off 2 st dev line yesterday, I'd wait if we dip more back to $3400 ish where theres some support. Could just as easily break through up though, it's been trading sideways for pretty much a year. Charts looks kinda retarded considering how solid their earnings have been for the last 3 quarters.
