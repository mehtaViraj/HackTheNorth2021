Here is the next AMZN play, and I got a nice graph to prove it so you retards don't ban me. Anyways, I got a nice run with an AMZN Call not long ago that confirmed this (at least in my eyes). so I am willing to put all of my money on it. Jeff Bezos wants his title back from Papa Musk.

Long story short, AMZN is about to pop. they have earnings coming in late January and we all know they KILLED IT! From previous years, they have been dominating the Black Friday and Ciber Mondays sales, so it is not surprising they did it again with all these covid restrictions. Now, timing is everything, so you still have to time the move. I believe it will rally and then pull back before the final rally up to the moon. you can get calls or spreads, both will pay very nice.

Positions $AMZN 3300/3350C for Jan 29.Once the pullback happens, then load on Calls. Price target AMZN $3400+

EDIT: here is a YOLO play from a fellow autist that agrees with the move. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kv6umy/yolo\_feb\_amazon\_calls\_and\_heres\_why/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kv6umy/yolo_feb_amazon_calls_and_heres_why/)

EDIT 2: got some $3110/3120C spreads expiring 1/15

EDIT 3: I am an autist and as some of you mentioned the Jan 29 date is an estimate. I rolled my AMZN 3300/3350C to Feb 12. I kept my $3110/3120C spreads exp 1/15.

EDIT 4: Im pretty sure no one is reading this, but I still want to have something to look back on if I am right. Lotto play AMZN $3280C Exp Jan 15
