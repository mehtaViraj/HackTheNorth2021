To my mind, Amazon is the company most likely to impact the market as a whole. Much of tech is blowing out expectations, but Amazon isn't just tech, it's everything, from retail goods to cloud services to aerospace. The problem for most traders, and why the stock has traded sideways for a long time, is the price. Tomorrow it's likely that rumors of a split will be dispelled (if there is a split forthcoming, I think most people would agree the stock would run). I'm interested to hear why people think the stock will spike or plummet. What has the street overlooked if they beat, what have they been bullish on with estimates that will miss?
