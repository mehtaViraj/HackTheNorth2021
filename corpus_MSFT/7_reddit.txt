Keep an eye on $DISCA $T $MSFT rumors are circulating that Microsoft could announce an acquisition at E3 tomorrow of some of WB Interactives' valuable assets (right now Rocksteady and NetherRealm are the leading candidates). AT&T had contemplated selling their gaming division last year but pulled back. This would relieve some valuable debt from the transaction between $DISCA $T and also provide $MSFT at least a couple of beloved studios that would boost GamePass and give them even more dominant IP in the gaming space. Right now these are **strong rumors** in the gaming community.

If this transaction is announced, expect volatility in all three tickers on Monday. I expect a run on $DISCA and possibly $T as the deal gets put back under the microscope by analysts and the sentiment turns positive.

Disclosure: I'm long $DISCA which is both oversold and the A class shares are being brutally shorted due to the upcoming merger which combines all classes - HF are shorting A class and buying into C class since all classes will combine at merger close by mid-2022.
