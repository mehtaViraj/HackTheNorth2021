I didnâ€™t know WW3 is going to look like this boys. Sometimes guts and big ballz are required in order to win. I sold the blue chip boomer stock Microsoft in order to be able to buy more GME. This is already beyond investing. Itâ€˜s much more. It doesnâ€™t even feel like a sacrifice, but rather as a contribution. 

This is a once in a lifetime opportunity and Iâ€˜m not going to miss it.

Hold the line! We are being shamelessly attacked by the fake news of CNBC, paid posts, bots and numerous distractions like BB and NOK.

I LIKE GME SO I BUY GME!! ðŸš€

IF ELON AND CHAMATH ARE WITH US, THEN WHO IS WITH THEM? Nobody. They are shit-scared and use cheap tactics in order to make us sell. Basically itâ€˜s them trying to manipulate the market, not us.

$GME TO ANDROMEDA! ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸŒŒðŸŒŒðŸŒŒ
