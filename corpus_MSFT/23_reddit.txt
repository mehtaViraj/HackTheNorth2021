So just a few hours ago there are several article about Solarwind hack. Microsoft is one of the victim of this hack. So naturally when ur locked is busted open, u are going to replace it but which lock will u be replacing it with? 

Just when the articles about Solarwind hack get released, BlackBerry said that they are in a partnership with Microsoft. Coincidence? I guess not, this is a well timed release to hint at investors that Microsoft will replace Solarwind with BlackBerry.

TLDR: All in $BB or get cucked
