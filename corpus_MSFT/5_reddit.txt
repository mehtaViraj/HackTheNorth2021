Look Microsoft has been killing it this year on the market. Yes I get it it's a successful company and we are in the business in making questionable choices but you literally cannot go tits up. Take a look at MSFT.

Trading MSFT calls is like printing money. There is a clear pattern here and I figure some of y'all might need some inspiration.

I go to sleep when the market opens and I wake up after it closes and I've still make a bunch of money off MSFT.

When to go in you might be asking? Wait for a sell off and go in on 2/3 week out options itm, or if you are feeling spicy load up on otm calls your choice. It's not a 10x stock, but most of you use that as an excuse to go -99%. Take this easy win.
