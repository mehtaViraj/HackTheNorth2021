If you have anything less than a March call, you're probably fucked. I wish it weren't true but Bezos can't just be happy with his $165 million mansion and is upset at the term "Microsoft" because it reminds him of his penis.

That being said, this will start to rebound in a week and then go back to normal uptrend in two weeks. 

So, yes, buy this dip but don't get emotional. If you're down, you're down. It sucks but that's the way the game goes. Just time this dip and make your money back. Put the losses in the back of your head and treat it as a completely new opportunity.

For those that have April or father out calls, you're fine and you'll get your tendies in due time.
