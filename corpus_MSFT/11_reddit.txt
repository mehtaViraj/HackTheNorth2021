Anti trust laws are in the talk right now, against the tech giants, what is your take on it and how will it effect the price of the stock?

How much power does the government actually have against these giants, and what is the plan to stop the “monopoly”?

My personal take that yes they are huge companies, and they so carry so much cash, however, without these big companies, the US economy wouldn’t be the same…. Thats just my take on it.

Finally, I feel like the government should focus more on providing a better work environment in Amazon since clearly it is an issue for almost everyone that worked there (including me).

GO APES!!
