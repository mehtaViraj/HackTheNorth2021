**Stocks finish in the red while Microsoft crushes earnings in after hours. The short squeeze continues to crush short sellers while EVs & Hydrogen are on the move. Let‚Äôs talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of yesterday as we saw all 3 major indexes finish the day down, with both the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/PspccJG) and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/rwB8b2z) losing .07% while the [SP500](https://ibb.co/qg7hSBb) dropped by .15% as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/NYVtHtF) remained pretty flat in a build-up day for today as the stock market is going to be hit with numerous economic data and big earnings reports from [Apple](https://ibb.co/kqJ38mj) which is expected to have their first $100B quarter, Boeing, Facebook, Tesla & many others.

We saw almost 60% of the [companies](https://ibb.co/7kH7Zjv) advancing with some companies dropping below the 50-day moving average as only 4 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/x6pRR2P) finished in the green, with Communications & Real Estate gaining more than 1% while Energy was the biggest laggard dropping more than 2% despite being the leader of the bunch in the early morning.

We also saw large-cap growth [companies](https://ibb.co/3svx5md) leading the way while the rest of the groups were lagging behind as you can also see in the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/S3ChnhR) from yesterday, with most of the small & mid-caps losing ground while the FAANG, Tesla, Microsoft and some other big companies were keeping the markets steady.

In terms of economic data, we saw the November housing price [index](https://ibb.co/dG3FNCJ) coming in as expected with a 11% increase y/y, which was also supported by the Shiller [Index](https://ibb.co/5ndWrBz) which indicated a 9.5% increase over last year, the biggest increase we have seen in this economic data in more than 6 years.

We also saw the January [consumer](https://ibb.co/vxdYwYy) confidence coming in better than expected at 89.3 with most of the increase coming from the expectations that consumers have of things getting better in the near future as the re-opening goes along.

Meanwhile the Richmond FED manufacturing [survey](https://ibb.co/F6PzgFL) came in at 14, lower than the 19 we saw last month as we saw a decrease in shipments, capacity utilization & volume of new orders.

In some other stock market news, we saw a lot of highly shorted stocks rise yet againüöÄüöÄüöÄ, with the forbidden one rose by more than 90% for the day and continuing with an additional 120% in after hours, while [Beyond Meat](https://ibb.co/rtQccJB) rose by 33% in early morning after announcing a partnership with [PepsiCo](https://ibb.co/wRL5s66) which is one of the biggest food companies in the world, as they will develop snack & beverage products that are plant-based.

We also saw the pot stocks rise again, with [Tilray](https://ibb.co/wpZGYPD) üöÄ leading the way after some national agencies from France tagged them to supply products for experiments in France. Tilray has been on a huge run since the Aphria merger news, and the company still has a lot of upside potential left especially if the Biden administration manages to push some sort of legislation, even if it isn‚Äôt a full-legalization in the US.

The same hopes of future help from the current administration were also seen in the EV & Hydrogen [sectors](https://ibb.co/3TwmFNC), with a lot of names like WorkHorse, Lordstown, Nikola & many others rising significantly yesterday

Some big companies also reported yesterday, as we saw General Electric [beating](https://ibb.co/0jpB660) most of the estimates in early morning and giving better than expected guidance on future free cash flow, which is a very big thing for a dividend paying company which has been struggling in the past years, while [JNJ](https://ibb.co/vQwJh52) also beat expectations and guided for even better revenues and earnings for next year as they are expecting vaccine results by next week, which could be huge for the hole stock market.

We also received a couple of big earnings reports in after hours, with [Starbucks](https://ibb.co/x3jzxHb) reporting pretty much as expected, but this high valuations for the stocks don‚Äôt really allow for OK quarters, everything needs to be exceptional for the most of the stocks to grow into these big valuations.

On the other hand, we saw [Microsoft](https://ibb.co/z8htnJC) crushing expectations, beating by almost $0.40 and a beat of more than $2.5B on revenues hitting over $40B in revenues for the first time due to the big demand in cloud revenues with Azure growing revenues by 50%, even better than the 48% in the last quarter. Microsoft also [guided](https://ibb.co/FYkGRSw) for upside in the next quarter, as this was a sleeping giant just like most of the big FAANG names which were underperformers for the better part of the end of 2020.

Meanwhile the other big tech name that reported was [AMD](https://ibb.co/fnB4Zvw), which also beat expectations due to big growth in all-areas of their business. I‚Äôll be making a Due Diligence in AMD probably later today as I really want to see what growth they have ahead as they continue to battle with Intel

So, let‚Äôs hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/ZhwtrgB) are mixed, with the Nasdaq leading the way as we also await MBA mortgage applications in the early [morning](https://ibb.co/3yGpYRj), but mostly expect to see what the FED announces later in the day, as they end the two-day meeting and it is very likely Powell & The FED will keep the interest rates close to 0% and remain very dovish, probably continuing the monthly $120B assets purchase program for the foreseeable future.
