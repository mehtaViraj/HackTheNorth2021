I'm sitting on Aug 21 $215 MSFT calls which have been losing money daily since earnings came out. 

&#x200B;

I held thinking that the stock movement was an overreaction to the earnings release but now I'm starting to think that going against the tape is irrational at this point.

Down 71% - but I have until Aug 21st for things to turn around. Should I hold or cut my losses?
