Ok retards, this is my first and maybe only post, so lets make it count!

I have been at this trading game for a while, mostly looking at a confluence of technical analysis and sometimes fundamentals.

It has since come to my attention the MSFT will be giving some free money in the next few weeks. Now I know that details doesn't matter here, so I will keep it short.

Please take a look at the daily chart and observe that this company is having a breakout on the 217 level. It is also confirmed with an upward pinbar and some larger than usual volumes. This along with all the other techs looking ready for another run up is enough to have me quite excited :)

Now I know this is a boomer stock, but remember free money is free money. This will probably not lead to an early retirement, but my guess is that you could at least double your money on a C230 or C240 expiring 22/01/2021.

Just be sure to sell on +-100% gains because I'm not sure it will reach those strikes. You're welcome!

TLDR MSFT C230 or C240 22/01/2021

Edit: I added a week to expiry to be safe, also ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€
