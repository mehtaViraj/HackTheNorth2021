I don’t make much.  $15.84/hr, after taxes and deductions it’s about $90 per day.

Today I made $110 on MSFT ($200c 3/20) and $63 on SPCE ($22c 2/21).

Nothing is guaranteed until I pull out.  It could keep going up or down.  But the fact that I have some choice in my own financial well-being is so eye-opening.  I didn’t have to suck dick or put on a happy voice (I work in a call center) to a rude piece of shit.  I just had to research and make the best decision I could with the knowledge that I have.

It’s not much.  In fact these are the first options I’ve ever bought.  But to know that this alternative exists actually made me enjoy my shift more today.  To know that I can set my own goals and take my own risks in a way that does not requiring appeasing other people.

It may be unrealistic to think I could retire in 5 years (at age 35), but sometimes the possibility alone can change your outlook on life, even if it’s unlikely.
