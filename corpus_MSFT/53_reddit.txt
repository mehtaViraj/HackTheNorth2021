I have around 10k worth of spare change and I want to yolo on something for once. I have been a pussy who heavily relies on safe and smart investment for my entire life, I just feel so G A Y ! Seeing y’all making retarded bets really makes me want to step up and be a fucking alpha for once. Sooo I’m thinking about putting in some good cash into MSFT $212c 7/31 because I have a good feeling about their earning report this upcoming week. What do y’all think? And if y’all think i also should yolo on something else pls feel free to drop some suggestions!
