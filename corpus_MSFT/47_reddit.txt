I have the following LEAPS.. (all MSFT)

* June 17th 2020 - 200 call (up 192%)
* June 16th 2023 - 220 call (up 89%)
* Jan 20 2023 - 260 call (up 174%)
* Mar 17th 2023 - 255 call (up 83%)

I've been following the strategy of Youtube user "InTheMoney" and buying calls that are already in somewhat deep in the money so the theta decay doesn't destroy me... ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95suqaJcFtU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95suqaJcFtU))

I have previously sold a June 16th 2021 - 160 call and bought two more calls with that profit (listed above)

The question I have for you all is when do you normally sell your LEAPS positions? I have nothing but confidence in MSFT so I am leaning towards holding until about 2-3 months until expiration. If there is one thing in life I've learned in my short career of trading, its to hold... Just looking for other thoughts/opinions on the matter, thanks!
