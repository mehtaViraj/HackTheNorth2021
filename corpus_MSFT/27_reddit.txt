Michael Pachter, of Wedbush, detailed how this works:

For example, if a customer signs up for the $15 monthly Xbox Game Pass Ultimate at a GameStop store, we would expect GameStop to receive $1.50 or so from that monthly revenue stream for as long as the customer continues to subscribe. If instead, the customer signs up for Xbox All Access for $35/month, GameStop would share $3.50 per month for 24 months.

Further:

That's right. In years 3 and 4 combined, if just 5 million customers extend the subscription for two years, GameStop makes $180 million in incremental profit with zero cost involved. That's nearly a quarter of GameStop's current market cap in recurring income at 100% margin!
