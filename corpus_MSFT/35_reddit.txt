Ever heard of Xcloud??? Probably not bc you’re autistic. Microsoft is releasing a “Netflix for games” subscription this month. 
Don’t give a fuck about video games??? Me neither, I remember when I was 5. 
What about the mother fucking environment pussie boi??? Microsoft is planning on being a “Zero Waste” company by 2030. 
Though I can bet that you’ve heard of the potential purchase of TikTok, where you can watch me do a fortnite dance over a huge pile of tendies while my wife’s boyfriend packs his shit in the background. 

Too much good news to be true? Don’t be a fucking retard. By the dip 

TLDR: MSFT mooning to tendie grown
