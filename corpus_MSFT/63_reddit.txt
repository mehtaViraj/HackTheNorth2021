All you TSLA crack fiends can sit down and read a moment about another stock. Still feeling bready after this solid DD / [brevidence](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hl4ymp/bread_has_been_empty_for_the_last_two_weeks_at/)

This is an 7/16 earnings play (SEE EDIT 2 AT BOTTOM). Now is time to early MSFT 220c 7/17, with goal to sell most contracts 7/16 once IV fomo is maxed out. Hold a pair to see how the market reacts as high erogenous risk.

Okay, MSFT used to be a boring-ass tech company. Then something happened back in 2014, Ballmer the Boomer stepped down to [buy a shitty](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2014/08/steve-ballmer-2-billion-clippers) sports team and my man [Satya Nutella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella) took over and has since spread his chocolatey goodness and rich hazelnut flavor across the nutty tech world. Competition is getting toasty, and MSFT is likely to beat earnings in the oven with strong future guidance. 

The seasoning:

* MS Teams performance is going to be a big deal, as it's [bundled with Office 365](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-teams-now-microsoft-reveals-when-you-can-expect-to-see-49-people-on-screen/) and fully integrated-- mid and large cap companies looking to strengthen work from home muscles would go with this since they likely already pay for it and trust boring MSFT over haute slack, etc.

* [Azure is a growth market](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/07/06/how-microsoft-created-800-billion-in-3-years--can-it-repeat/#1fa6e54c7dd1) during all this, plenty of room for cloud growth in lots of sectors, including government and education, where MSFT holds many, many long-term or no limit contracts

* Last earnings call MSFT said they [saw "minimal" impact](https://www.barrons.com/articles/microsoft-stock-rises-after-company-says-covid-19-had-minimal-impact-on-fiscal-third-quarter-earnings-51588193445) due to COVID--and as far as I can tell this is a company basically custom built for a stay-at-home pandemic

* Xbox is a big deal, and the Gamepass streaming tech is getting a major invest, already way [outperforming Sony 5x](https://www.businessinsider.com/xbox-game-pass-is-much-bigger-than-playstation-now-2020-5) with many tier 1 titles and early access, etc., also the FB partnership is important for growth

* Salesforce brought the CRM battle home to Seattle with the purchase of Tableau, and MSFT has been [steadily facelifting](https://msdynamicsworld.com/story/microsoft-launches-preview-dynamics-365-project-operations-how-we-got-here) Dynamics, which it sells to enterprise and gov't customers for a huge premium, sometimes bundling with Power BI

* And the company still puts [emphasis on B2C](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2020/07/01/introducing-new-onedrive-features-to-share-and-collaborate-across-work-and-life/), because you can still buy individual "ownership" licenses of products like Windows and Office, instead of SaaS only, demonstrating market flexibility to maximize profits

* Moat only getting dug deeper through lots of [cross-platform integration](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/microsoft-teams-and-skype-users-can-now-chat-together/) and product bundling (e.g. I can now see *all* my software including xbox from one account)

* Also, I like that MSFT takes 2-4 year risks, and then gets out if it doesn't go well--they're [closing the retail stores](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/techburger/article/R-I-P-Microsoft-Stores-We-hardly-knew-ye-And-15377633.php) they'd opened, which I think is smart baking

The image of MSFT is improving--a lot of the toxic culture stuff has been going away since the invention of Nutella and the stock has been rising steadily now that the market has taken notice. They're able to attract more talent, and they have restructured their leadership.

My positions: MSFT 220c 7/17, MSFT 215c 9/18. I'll admit I also want to buy stock. I'm that retarded for this toasty loaf. Gonna go eat some bread now.

p.s. ebay is a shithole company and it should die a torturous, mutilated death

edit: formatting

p.s.s. go re-watch the patriot,  it's a great film

edit 2: msft announced earnings will be 7/22 instead of 7/16 as expected. Still recommend 7/24 calls at 220, or 212.5/215 if you're uneasy.
